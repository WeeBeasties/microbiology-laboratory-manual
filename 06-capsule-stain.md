# **Exercise 06**

## **Capsule Stain**

-------------

### **Background**

Most microorganisms are covered by a layer of polysaccharide. This layer varies greatly in its extent between species. Very thin – difficult to detect – layers are referred to as a glycocalyx. Much more robust layers are called capsules. The primary function of a microbial capsule is to evade phagocytosis. Secondary functions of capsules include aggregation of cells, biofilm formation, and attachment to some surfaces. Most mucosal pathogens employ capsules as one of their main virulence factors.

The capsule stain does not actually stain the capsule. Instead, India ink is spread on the slide. The ink is too large to enter the cell and is excluded by the capsule too. We will visualize the cell bodies in this exercise using a simple stain \(crystal violet\). When correctly performed, your slides should have a dark black background \(ink\), purple rods or cocci \(microbial cells\), and clear areas around the cells \(the capsule\).

### **Instructions**

One person in your pair will work to visualize the capsules formed by both _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Cryptococcus neoformans_. Complete these steps for each isolate.

Put a loop of water at one end of a clean microscope slide. \(drop of _K. pneumoniae_\)

Flame sterilize a loop and touch the _Cryptococcus neoformans_ growth on the slant.

Briefly mix the microbe in the drop of water on the slide.

Add one drop of India ink to the microbial suspension and make a smear using another slide as indicated here.

Air dry, but do not heat fix. Then cover the slide with crystal violet for one minute. Gently rinse the slide and allow to air dry. View your preparations using the oil immersion objective.

### **Notebook Entry**

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ **Observations**

• Carefully record the size, shape, arrangement, and color of the cells in your capsule stains. Indicate \(using arrows\) the cells, the India ink background, and the capsules. You should have one observation for each microbe.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1\) Record the view of the ocular micrometers and bacterial cells in focus for each of the eight different samples. Make sure that you clearly label your samples.



2\) Using the panels below, draw an accurate representation of each sample. Make sure that you label each sample well. Also ensure that your drawings show the correct size, shape, arrangement, and color of each cell type.



✪ **Conclusions**

1. Which of these microbes is a eukaryote?

2. What group \(kingdom or domain\) of microbes includes _Klebsiella pneumoniae_?

3. What group \(kingdom or domain\) of microbes includes _Cryptococcus neoformans_?

4. What type of diseases do these microbes cause and why do they both make capsules?



**Housekeeping**

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

**Glass waste**

Dispose of your microscope slides in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. **Do not **put anything sharp into the regular trash.

**Bacterial cultures**

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. _Cryptococcus neoformans_ \(BSL-2\). This is a common environmental microbe. It can be transmitted in bird feces.

2. _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ \(BSL-2\) Strains of this microbe can cause pneumoniae in kids.

Return the microbial cultures when you have completed your stains.

**Contaminated materials**

We should not contaminate anything today. If you do, however, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

**Compound light microscope**

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X \(red striped, scan\) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.

**Laboratory bench**

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount \(a few milliliters\) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

**Cell phone \/ camera**

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

**Hand washing**

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today \(and _**every day**_\) in the lab.
