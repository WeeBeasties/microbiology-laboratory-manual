## Background

Accurate characterization and identification of microbes relies upon access to pure cultures. Unfortunately, microbial cultures are nearly always complex mixtures in nature. During the “Golden Age” of microbiology \(19th century\), many different groups worked to find efficient means to isolate single microbes from these mixed communities. In Koch’s laboratory, agar was used to make irreversible solid media for the first time. This allowed microbiologists to easily isolate bacteria by streaking. Streaking for isolation is a form of dilution on a solid surface. use and storage of our microscopes. You will be practicing this technique today with a simple mixed culture of bacteria.

When we grow pure or mixed cultures on solid media, microbes appear in large enough numbers to be visible to the naked eye. These colonies of microbes can be distinguished by several different physical characteristics. Below is a partial listing of some more common morphological features used to describe colonies in the lab.

**Size - **Microbial colonies can vary quite a bit in their overall size \(diameter\). Punctiform colonies appear as pinpoints. Most other colonies have diameters that can be measured in mm.

**Shape - **The overall shape of the colonies can vary as well. Some of the common shapes are illustrated below, and include the following: **Round** - many colonies have a nice radial symmetry and appear as round mounds of growth. **Irregular** - other colonies have less symmetry and have undulating edges. **Fibrous** - some soil bacteria have fibrous or hairy colonies. **Rhizoid** – a few bacteria \(and many fungi\) have a spreading and branching type of growth. **Curled** - due to swarming on the plate, some colonies have a terraced appearance that is called curled.

**Margin - **The edge, or margin, of the colony may also have several appearances as drawn below. **Entire** - colonies with a smooth and even edge are referred to as entire. **Fibrous** - some colonies have a filamentous edge and are called fibrous. **Lobate** - other colonies can have an irregular, lobed edge. **Serrate** - finally, some can have a saw-tooth edge which is called either **serrate** or **erose** \(eroded\).

**Elevation - **The height, or elevation, of the colony may also have several appearances as drawn above. **Flat** - some colonies have very little elevation and remain flat on the agar surface. **Raised** - many colonies have some elevation and appear somewhat raised from the surface. **Convex** - other colonies form a substantial pile of cells with a dome-like structure. **Cateriform** - a few colonies exhibit depressions in the center and could also be called concave. **Umbonate** - still others have an extra dimple in the center. **Pitted** - rarely, some microbes are able to metabolize the agar in the media. This can result in the colonies pitting into the growth medium.

**Color - **Most microbial colonies have similar coloration; there are lots of variants of cream to tan. However, there are examples of microbes that produce white, black, yellow, red, pink, purple, and other colored colonies.

**Consistency - **The overall consistency of the microbial culture can be tested by touching with a sterile loop. Some of the common consistencies include: **Butyrous**; Most bacterial colonies have a buttery consistency. **Viscous**; Others are more sticky. **Mucous**; Still others have a slimy consistency. This is often due to the production of a capsule. Friable. Some colonies \(like the mycobacteria\) have hard and waxy colonies that break up upon probing.

**Surface - **The surface of the colonies can also vary. Most appear to be smooth and\/or shiny. The presence of a capsule can contribute to this. Others appear dull or rough, while others yet may be wrinkled.

**Opacity - **Lastly, the colonies can vary in their opacity. Most will appear to be opaque on the plates. However, others will have varying degree of translucence. 

 You should note that colony morphology varies from bacterium to bacterium. However, the morphology is also strongly affected by the growth medium and environmental conditions \(temperature, humidity, etc\) used. In general, we assume that a pure culture will only exhibit one kind of colony morphology, while a mixed culture should have more than one type of colony present. As always, there are exceptions to this rule.



**Instructions**

You will be given one plate of media and a mixed culture containing _Escherichia coli_ and _Staphylococcus aureus._ Sterilize a wire loop by incineration and let it cool for about 10 seconds. Then get one loopful of the mixed culture and apply it to your plate as shown in “A” to the right. Sterilize your loop again and let it cool. Now use one edge of your loop to spread as shown in “B”. Turn you loop around and use the other edge to spread as shown in “C”. Finally, sterilize your loop one last time and let it cool. Complete the streaking as shown in “D” \(use the rest of the available area\). Label the bottom of your plate with your name, lab section, date, and sample information using a Sharpie. Put your plate in the 35°C incubator on your lab section’s shelf \(bottoms up\).

After 24 to 48 hours, the microbes will have multiplied enough that macroscopic piles of microscopic cells \(colonies\) will be visible on your plates. If you have succeeded, some of these colonies will be isolated – not touching other colonies. We make the assumption that such colonies arose from one isolated cell. Since bacteria reproduce asexually by binary fission, all of the cells in a colony should be genetically identical \(the colony should be clonal\).

**Notebook Entry**

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ **Observations**

• Record the view of your streak plate after incubation.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1\) Photograph the plate with your digital camera, print the picture, tape it into your lab notebook and label it appropriately. Make sure that the colony morphology is discernable.

2\) Draw the appearance of your streak plate by hand. Make sure that degree of isolation and the colony morphology is discernable.

✪ **Conclusions**

1\) Did you see isolated colonies?

2\) How many colony types did you see?

3\) Describe the morphology of your colonies.

**Housekeeping**

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

**Glass waste**

There should be no glass waste today. However, you should now know where to dispose of broken glass in the lab.

**Bacterial cultures**

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. We are using a mixed culture of:

1. _Escherichia coli_ \(BSL-1\). This is a common member of your gut microbiota.

2. _Staphylococcus aureus_ \(BSL-2\) This is commonly found on your skin and in your nose.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed streak plate.

**Contaminated materials**

When you have completed your observations of the petri dish \(following incubation\), you should dispose of the plates in the lined silver buckets at the front of the laboratory.

**Laboratory bench**

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount \(a few milliliters\) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

**Cell phone \/ camera**

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

**Hand washing**

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today \(and _**every day**_\) in the lab.
