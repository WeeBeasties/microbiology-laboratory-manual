# **Exercise 08**

## **Acid-Fast Stain**

-------------

### **Background**

The Kinyoun stain is a type of differential stain used to visualize acid-fast bacteria. This will be the third, and final, differential stain that will be used in our labs. The waxy mycolic acids in the cell wall of these microbes prevents most stains from directly binding to them. This procedure is often used to detect pathogens like _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and _Mycobacterium leprae_ in clinical samples. There are other types of acid fast stains as well such as Auramine-rhodamine \(a fluorescence stain\) and the Ziehl-Neelsen stain \(which uses heat as a mordant\). The primary stain and mordant are applied together in this protocol. At least 15 minutes is required for decent staining. Longer is better.



| Step | Compound | Time | Acid-fast | Non Acid-fast |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary Stain | Basic fuchsin | 15 minutes | Colorless | Red |
| Mordant | Phenol | Red | Red |  |
| Decolorizer | Acid alcohol | ~10 seconds | Red | Colorless |
| Secondary Stain | Methylene blue | 1 minute | **Red** | **Blue** |

### **Instructions**

You will work individually to perform this stain on a mixture of an acid-fast cell \(_Mycobacterium smegmatis_\) and a non acid-fast cell \(_Staphylococcus aureus_\).

· Put a loop of water on a clean microscope slide.

· Flame sterilize a loop and add a small quantity of _Mycobacterium smegmatis_ \(acid-fast bacilli\) to the water. Spread the cells out well; the waxy mycolic acids are repelled by water, so this takes some effort. Spend _at least_ a minute trying to break up any chunks.

· Flame sterilize a loop and add a really small quantity of _Staphylococcus aureus_ \(non-acid-fast cocci\) to the same slide. Spread these out too.

· Air dry and heat fix the mixed sample.

· Perform the acid-fast stain using the procedure in the table above.

· Rinse your slides with water between each step and blot dry with bibulous paper when complete.

· View the cells using your oil immersion objective.



**Notebook Entry**

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.



✪ **Observations**

• Carefully record the size, shape, arrangement, and color of the cells in your samples. Search around your slide and make sure that you see both the acid-fast and the non acid-fast cells.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1\) Record the view of the ocular micrometers and bacterial cells in focus for each of the eight different samples. Make sure that you clearly label your samples.

2\) Using the panels below, draw an accurate representation of each sample. Make sure that you label each sample well. Also ensure that your drawings show the correct size, shape, arrangement, and color of each cell type.







✪ **Conclusions**

1. Acid-fast cells often clump up on the slides. Why might that be?

2. List three diseases that are associated with acid-fast bacteria \(your may need to refer to the internet or your textbook.

3. How is the appearance of an acid-fast bacillus similar or different from the appearance of a gram negative bacillus?

**Housekeeping**

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

**Glass waste**

Dispose of your microscope slides in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. **Do not **put anything sharp into the regular trash.

**Bacterial cultures**

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. _Mycobacterium smegmatis_ \(BSL-1\). This is a fast growing acid-fast microbe. It can be found on healthy human skin and is rarely pathogenic.

2. _Staphylococcus aureus_ \(BSL-2\) This is commonly found on your skin and in your nose.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your stains.

**Compound light microscope**

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X \(red striped, scan\) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.

**Contaminated materials**

We should not contaminate anything today. If you do, however, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

**Laboratory bench**

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount \(a few milliliters\) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

**Cell phone \/ camera**

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

**Hand washing**

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today \(and _**every day**_\) in the lab.
