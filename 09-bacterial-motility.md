# **Exercise 09**

## **Bacterial Motility**

-------------

### **Background**

Flagella are external bacterial structures that enable motility in liquid media. They move the cells by rapidly rotating and providing thrust. Unfortunately, these structures are very thin and fragile. This make direct examination in the lab difficult. We will, therefore, only use prepared slides and observe motility directly. Flagella can be arranged in four different ways as shown below. You will see some of these arrangements today.

### **Instructions**

Observe each of the commercially prepared flagella slides using your oil immersion objective.

In addition, you should observe the blood agar plates inoculated with _Proteus mirabilis_ and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_.

Finally, you will need to prepare hanging drop preparations of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Proteus mirabilis_ cells to observe their motility.

· Use a toothpick to put a dab of petroleum jelly on the corners of a two coverslips.

· Put a loop of one culture in the center of a coverslip.

· Place a concave slide over the coverslips so that the culture is centered in the depression of the slide.

· Flip the slide over so that the coverslips are on top.

· View using your oil immersion \(you will want to reduce the brightness of the light using the iris in the substage condenser\).

· Try to determine which of the cultures \(if any\) are motile.

**Notebook Entry**

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.



✪ **Observations**

• Carefully record the size, shape, arrangement, and color of the cells in your samples. Search around your slides and make sure that you see both amphitrichous and peritrichous flagella.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1\) Record the view of the ocular micrometers and bacterial cells in focus for each of the eight different samples. Make sure that you clearly label your samples.

2\) Using the panels below, draw an accurate representation of each sample. Make sure that you label each sample well. Also ensure that your drawings show the correct size, shape, arrangement, and color of each cell type.







• Carefully record the appearance of the cultures on the blood agar plates. Once again, either produce a detailed drawing by hand or include photographs in your lab notebook. Please make sure that you clearly label your illustrations.

• Finally, you should describe what you saw in your two hanging drop slides. An illustration is not necessary since this is a kinetic observation \(a movie would be more helpful – but difficult to get in a lab notebook.



✪ **Conclusions**

1. Why did the _Proteus mirabilis _plate look the way that it did \(curled\) in lab?

2. What flagellar arrangement does _Proteus mirabilis _exhibit?

3. Draw and label all four types of flagellar arrangements possible.

4. If _Klebsiella_ is non-motile, why were the cells moving in the wet mount in lab?



**Housekeeping**

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

**Glass waste**

Dispose of your coverslips in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. **Do not **put anything sharp into the regular trash.

**Commercial Slides**

Do not throw the commercial slides or the hanging drop slides away! Wipe any immersion oil off of the slides using a Kimwipe. Then return the slide to the correct slide box. Return the hanging drop slides to the indicated container for later cleaning.

**Bacterial cultures**

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. _Proteus mirabilis_ \(BSL-2\). This microbe is commonly found in soil and water. This species – though not this strain – accounts for about 90% of all _Proteus _infections.

2. _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ \(BSL-2\) Strains of this microbe can cause pneumoniae in kids.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your stains.

**Compound light microscope**

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X \(red striped, scan\) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.

**Contaminated materials**

We should not contaminate anything today. If you do, however, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

**Laboratory bench**

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount \(a few milliliters\) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.



**Cell phone \/ camera**

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

**Hand washing**

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today \(and _**every day**_\) in the lab.
