Gram Positive Cocci Biochemistry

Background

Like the Enterobacteriaceae, various Gram positive cocci (GPC) can be distinguished and identified using different biochemical tests. We are going to use several different media to differentiate between (and ultimately, to identify) various members of this group. Here is a little background on the tests that we are using.

Mannitol salt agar: This is a selective and differential medium. The media contains 6.5% NaCl – which inhibits the growth of most organisms. It also contains phenol red dye and mannitol. Microbes the grow on Mannitol salt agar may either ferment mannitol or not. If they do, the acids they produce turn the indicator dyes in the media yellow. If mannitol is not fermented, the media remains red.

Catalase: Catalase is an enzyme that decomposes hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen gas. When hydrogen peroxide is placed on the microbes, the production of bubbles indicates a positive reaction.

EF broth: This media contains a fermentable sugar (glucose) and an acid indicator (bromcresol purple). Glucose fermentation results in acid end products. These, in turn, cause the media to turn yellow. The media also contains a metabolic poison – sodium azide. Only azide-resistant microbes can grow,ferment the glucose, and turn yellow. A negative result remains purple (no growth).

NaCl broth: Like the Mannitol salt agar, this broth contains 6.5% NaCl. Only halotolerant microbes and grow and turn the media cloudy. No growth is negative.

Bile esculin slant: This media is used to detect the metabolism a compound called esculin. If it is converted to esculetin, it will react with iron in the media and turn completely black. A negative result remains tan. Bile acids in this media inhibit the growth of most Gram positive organisms.

DNase: Some bacteria can break down DNA to nucleotides. This reaction is visualized by adding HCl to the DNA plate after microbes have been cultured. The low pH causes intact DNA to precipitate within the media – turning the plate cloudy. However, any areas where the DNA has been hydrolyzed will not precipitate. This is appear as clear areas around the growth of positive cultures. Negative cultures will not have a clear zone..

Sheep blood agar: Some bacteria can break down blood cells using toxins called hemolysins. This results in three patterns of clearing on the plate (hemolysis).

Alpha () hemolysis: Partial breakdown of red blood cells – resulting in a smoky green color. The plate is obviously not red anymore and it is not clear either.

Beta () hemolysis: Complete breakdown of red blood cells – resulting in complete clearing. You can read text through these plates now.

Gamma () hemolysis: No clearing. The plates have growth on them, but they are just as red as when they were inoculated.

Two antibiotic disks are also used on our blood agar plate. These are:

A: Bacitracin – an inhibitor of peptidoglycan biosynthesis that group A streptococci are particularly susceptible to.

P: Optochin – a copper containing compound that pneumococci are particularly susceptible to.

Instructions

Just as before, you should observe each of the sets of inoculated media and interpret the results that you see. The catalase test will need to be performed once for each isolate in lab. Based upon the results that you record, you should create a dichotomous key that is sufficient to identify any of the eight bacterial isolates. See the Enterobacteriaceae exercise for instructions concerning dichotomous keys.

Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ Observations

• Carefully record the reactions of all the biochemical tests for the six organisms. Please record your antibiotic results as either resistant (no zone of inhibition) or susceptible (zone of inhibition). It is much less ambiguous that way.

You might consider including representative pictures of the tests too (either hand drawn or photographs of the media). This could be very helpful when you are studying for the laboratory practical exam. Just saying…

✪ Conclusions

1. A complete and correct dichotomous key (based upon your observations) is the only conclusion necessary for this exercise. You will be using this key to identify a bacterial unknown in a future exercise.

Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. Staphylococcus aureus (BSL-2). This microbe is the leading cause of wound infections. Even our teaching strain is a fairly aggressive opportunistic pathogen. Handle it carefully.

2. Staphylococcus epidermidis (BSL-1) This organism is part of the normal skin microbiota. It can cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals.

3. Streptococcus pyogenes (BSL-2) This is the organism that causes strep throat, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever.

4. Streptococcus pneumoniae (BSL-2) This organism is the leading cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

5. Streptococcus salivarius (BSL-1). This microbe is normal member of your oral microbiota. It is rarely pathogenic.

6. Enterococcus faecalis (BSL-2). This microbe is commonly found in bird and reptile feces. We used it as a indicator strain (fecal streptococci) in an earlier lab.

Return the bacterial cultures when you have completed your observations.

Contaminated materials

We should not contaminate anything today. If you do, however, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
