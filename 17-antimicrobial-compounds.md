Antimicrobial Compounds

Background

We often wish to kill or inhibit the growth of microbes in our environment. Today, we will be examining three types of antimicrobial compounds and compare their effectiveness using the disk diffusion assay.

The first group of chemicals that we will employ are disinfectants. These compounds are used on inanimate objects (telephones, desks, etc.) and tend to be more toxic. The chemical that we are using represent some of the chemical classes mentioned in lecture.

The next group of chemicals that we will employ are antiseptics. These compounds are used on living surfaces (like your skin) and tend to be much less toxic. The chemical that we are using represent some of the chemical classes mentioned in lecture.

The final group of chemicals that we will employ are antibiotics. These compounds are produced by other microorganisms and tend to be used chemotherapeutically. The drugs that we are using today target one of the two main bacterial target structures.

We will apply the compounds using paper disks and the chemical will diffuse into the media (that is why it is called the disk diffusion method!). In this process, a chemical gradient will be created. A threshold concentration (called the minimum inhibitory concentration) is necessary to kill or inhibit the microbial growth.

Instructions

To inoculate your plates, you will perform what I call a 3+1 streak procedure. Each group will be assigned a specific microbe to test. Label the bottoms of three petri dishes with your symbol, the organism’s name, and your section. Divide two of the plates into quarters on the bottom using a sharpie. Leave the third plate undivided. Dip a sterile swab into your culture tube (or diluted culture tube for antibiotics).

• Swab the complete surface of the agar plate. Rotate the plate 120° and streak the entire surface again. Repeat once more by rotating and streaking. Finally, streak around the perimeter of the plate a couple of times. See the drawing to the right.

• Label the quarters of your plates for the antiseptics or disinfectants as shown in the introduction. Place a sterile paper disk on each quarter using a disinfected forceps. Then add one drop of the corresponding compound to each disk and allow to soak in.

• We will dilute your microbial stock for the antibiotic plate inoculation (except for the Candida albicans groups – they will use undiluted microbes). Obtain a standard tube (STD) and mix by shaking. You will use a Pasteur pipette to add you culture into a fresh tube of nutrient broth until it is approximately as cloudy as the standard (around a dozen or two drops should do it). Use the diluted microbes to do a 3 + 1 streak of your final plate.

• Use the antibiotic disk applicators to place 6 pre-loaded antibiotic disks onto your plate.

• Incubate all three plates bottoms up in a stack in the 35°C incubator.

• We will measure the diameters of the zones of inhibition to determine the relative efficacy of each compound. • The clinical meaning of the zones of inhibition will be interpreted using the table provided below.



Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.



✪ Observations

• Carefully record the size of the zones of inhibition on your three plates.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1) Photograph all three plates and tape the labeled photos in your notebook. Also complete the data table provided.

2) Carefully draw pictures of all three plates and tape the labeled photos in your notebook. Also complete the data table provided.



✪ Conclusions

1. Which disinfectant worked best?

2. Which antiseptic worked best?

3. Which was more effective, the best disinfectant or best antiseptic?

4. Which microbe was most susceptible to the disinfectants?

5. Which microbe was most susceptible to the antibiotics?

6. Which microbe was most resistant to the antibiotics?

7. Which bacterium was most susceptible to the antibiotics?





Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

Dispose of your Pasteur pipettes in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash.

Microbial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. Candida albicans (BSL-1) Candida albicans (BSL-1) This yeast is a member of our body’s normal microbiota.

2. Escherichia coli (BSL-1). The K12 strain is the most studied organism on the planet.

3. Klebsiella pneumoniae (BSL-2) Strains of this microbe can cause pneumoniae in kids.

4. Proteus vulgaris (BSL-2). This microbe is commonly found in soil and water. This bacterium can sometimes cause urinary tract infections.

5. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (BSL-2) This is commonly found in wet environments and can be a potent pathogen under the right circumstances.

6. Salmonella enteritidis (BSL-2) This microbe is associated with food-borne infections.

7. Shigella sonnei (BSL-2) This microbe is also associated with food-borne infections.

8. Staphylococcus aureus (BSL-2) This is commonly found on your skin and in your nose.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your stains.

Contaminated materials

Dispose of your used cotton swabs in the orange bag-lined silver cans when you have completed your inoculations. Your petri dishes should go there too when you have completed your observations.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
