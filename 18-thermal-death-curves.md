Thermal Death Curves

Background

Microbes differ in their sensitivity to heat. Treated long enough at a high enough temperature, bacterial cells (and even endospores) will die. The D-value represents the conditions – time, temperature, and other parameters – that results in a reduction of the bacterial population by 90%. That is, only 10% (one log) of the viable cells remain. Many applied microbiologists want to sterilize objects. To do so, they must treat the object such that enough D-values have elapsed to ensure that all cells have been killed. There are two ways to measure this: the thermal death time and the thermal death point.

The thermal death time is measured while holding temperature constant. The question answered is, “how long must we heat at this temperature to kill all viable cells?”

The thermal death point is measured while holding time constant. The question answered is, “how hot must we heat for this length of time to kill all viable cells?”

Today, we will measure the thermal death time and thermal death point for three different bacterial cultures.

Instructions

· We will work in 15 groups 1 or 2 people per group . Each group will be responsible for sampling one of our microbes at one of the temperatures.

· Every group will need 5 empty petri dishes. Label the bottoms (the smaller diameter piece) with your section number and the organism name using a sharpie. Label each plate for one of our time points 0, 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes . Transfer 0.1 ml of your culture into the bottom of the empty 0 minute plate. Add growth media to your sample by pouring in a molten 12 ml pour tube, mix by slowly swirling, and cover.

· Next, put your bacterial culture tube into the water bath at your specified temperature. After one minute elapses, withdraw a 0.1 ml aliquot and deliver it to the bottom of the 1 minute plate. Add media, swirl, and cover. Repeat this process at 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes.

· After all of your plates have hardened 10 minutes , place them as a stack – bottoms up – in the 30°C incubator. We will evaluate the microbial growth next time.

Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ Observations

• Record the growth of your organism for each of your five plates. I suggest that you rate a plate with 0 to 10 colonies as a (–) and those with 11 or more colonies a (+).

• Obtain the other growth scores from your classmates.

• You may record these data using the following tables and taping them into your notebook. Alternatively, you can create your own tables in your notebook.

1) Record the view of the ocular micrometers and bacterial cells in focus for each of the

✪ Conclusions

1. What were the thermal death times for each organism?

2. What were the thermal death points for each organism at 5 minutes?

3. Which microbe had the highest thermal death point?

4. Speculate upon why the organism in question three might be heat tolerant.

Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

Dispose of your used pipettes in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash. Dispose of your empty tubes in the silver cans that do not have an orange bag.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. Bacillus megaterium (BSL-1). This is yet another common endospore-forming soil bacterium.

2. Escherichia coli (BSL-1). The K12 strain is the most studied organism on the planet.

3. Staphylococcus aureus (BSL-2) This is commonly found on your skin and in your nose.

Dispose of your bacterial strains in the unlined silver cans at the end of your heat treatments.

Contaminated materials

If your spill your culture, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets. When you are finished observing your plates, they should be placed in the silver cans lined with an orange biohazard bag.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
