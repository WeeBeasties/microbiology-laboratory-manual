## Background

Being able to locate, observe, and record bacterial cells using our compound light microscopes is an essential laboratory skill. In today’s exercise, you will use commercially prepared slides containing three different bacterial strains. These bacterial cells represent the three most common shapes – cocci \(balls\), bacilli \(rods\), and spiral \(curved rods\). Some of the most common shapes and arrangements of bacterial cells are illustrated below. You will need to be conversant with this term for both our lecture and laboratory assignments.

## Instructions

Each student should get one prepared microscope slide \(there will be three distinct patches of stained bacteria on slide\). Center and focus the slide using a low-power objective \(4X or 10X\) first. Then switch to high dry \(40X\) and focus using the fine focus – red knob – only. Finally, rotate the 40X objective out of the way and place one drop of immersion oil on the slide \(where it its being illuminated\). Rotate the 100X oil immersion lens into the drop of oil and focus using fine focus only. You should photograph or draw the cells that you see to scale. Use proper terminology to describe their shape and arrangement and give an estimate of their size in µm based upon your calibrated micrometer.

## **Notebook Entry**

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ **Observations**

• Record the view of the ocular micrometers and bacterial cells in focus for each of the three types of microbial cell shapes.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1\) Photograph the view through your right ocular with your digital camera, print the picture, tape it into your lab notebook and label it appropriately.

2\) Using the panels below, draw a black bar beneath the ocular scale and indicate how many stage division it represents. For example, if 12 stage divisions equaled 40 ocular divisions, the black bar should extend from 0 to 4 and be labeled “12”. Draw the letter e to scale against the ocular divisions.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |

Calculate the size of each type of microbial cell \(show your calculations\).

✪ **Conclusions**

Answer the following questions and complete this data table.

1\) What are the three shapes of cells that you saw? \(use the terms from the figure\)

2\) Which of the cells was the longest?

3\) Which of the cells was the smallest?



**Housekeeping**

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

**Glass waste**

There should be no glass waste today. However, you should now know where to dispose of broken glass in the lab.

**Compound light microscope**

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X \(red striped, scan\) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.

**Commercial Slides**

Do not throw the commercial slides away! Wipe any immersion oil off of the slides using a Kimwipe. Then return the slide to the correct slide box.

**Laboratory bench**

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount \(a few milliliters\) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

**Cell phone \/ camera**

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

**Hand washing**

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today \(and _**every day**_\) in the lab.
