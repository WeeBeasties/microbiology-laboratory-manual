# **Exercise 10**

## **Protozoa**

### **Background**

The protozoa are single-celled, non-photosynthetic, primarily free-living organisms. While they do not possess a cell wall, many are covered by a series of flexible protein strips called the **pellicle**. The pellicle maintains the cell’s shape and provides strength while remaining flexible. Members of the protozoa include several important human pathogens. These cells can reproduce asexually by binary fission either longitudinally \(lengthwise\) or laterally \(widthwise\). Some members of the protozoa can also undergo a type of sexual reproduction. The protozoan life cycle is **polymorphic** \(having more than one stage\). The infective form, or resting form, is the **cyst**. This stage is resistant to heat, acid, and drying – but less so than a bacterial endospore. If the cyst is ingested, the active form - the **trophozoite** - will grow out. This stage actively grows and reproduces. Under unfavorable conditions, the trophozoites will form cysts, which rest in the environment until favorable conditions for growth are again encountered. In addition, many protozoa are also **pleomorphic** \(having more than one trophozoite form\). The protozoa have traditionally been classified into four groups based upon their mechanism of motility – the amoeba, the ciliates, the flagellates, and the non-motile organisms. However, recent taxonomic work has revealed the protists to be polyphyletic \(they are split amongst many different groups that are only distantly related genetically\). Some of the more important of these groups are discussed below.

The first group, the** Amoebozoa**, includes organisms that move using **pseudopodia** \(“false feet”\) - namely the amoeba. The amoebae reproduce by binary fission and feed by engulfing their prey with their pseudopodia. Pathogenic sarcodines include _Entamoeba histolytica_, which is the causative agent of amoebic dysentery, and _Naegleria fowleri_. **Cercozoa** are another group of amoeba that differs by having a calcium carbonate shell \(called a test\). The **plasmodial slime molds** are also related to the amoebas. Most of these organisms \(Amoebozoa, Cercozoa, and slime molds\) are free-living and non-pathogenic.

A second group of protozoa are the** Alveolata**. Members this clade possess a complex cortical structure containing alveoli, extrusomes, and a microtubule framework. These microbes can be further divided into three main sub-groupings. The first of these is the **Ciliophora**. These include organisms that move using **cilia** \(“eyelashes”\). Most of the ciliates are free living, including _Paramecium_ and _Didinium_, which are common inhabitants of pond water. The Ciliophora reproduce asexually by longitudinal binary fission. The ciliates contain two nuclei. The macronucleus contains several active copies of the chromosomes, which are used by the cell for growth and metabolism. The smaller nucleus, the micronucleus, contains one quiescent copy of the chromosomes. This second copy is used during genetic exchange. In sexual reproduction, two ciliates fuse in a process called conjugation. During conjugation, the micronuclei are exchanged. The only parasitic ciliate is _Balantidium coli_. This ciliate, the largest protozoan found in the gut, causes diarrhea. **Dinoflagellates** and. **Apicomplexans** are the final sub-group of the Alveolata, and consists of many different **non-motile** protozoa. These protozoans are **obligate parasites** and cause several important human diseases. The **Apicomplexa** are characterized by the presence of several organelles at one tip of the cell and include _Plasmodium_, which is the causative agent of malaria, as well as _Toxoplasma_ and _Sarcocystis_.

**Discicristata** or **Euglenozoa** are members of what was once referred to as **Mastigophora** - organisms that move using a **flagellum** \(“whip”\). These organisms reproduce either by lateral binary fission or a complex sexual cycle involving two different hosts. The cells have a deep oral groove and possess disk-shaped mitochondria. Several of these flagellates are important human pathogens. The hemoflagellates affect the circulatory system of infected humans. This includes _Trypanosoma_ and _Leishmania, _both of which cause severe human infections. The sexual cycles of these parasites occurs in an insect or arthropod vector. When a carrier bites a human, the blood stream is infected. The trophozoite of these organisms has several stages, and eventually new gametophytes are generated which are able to infect another insect when it takes a blood meal from an infected human. Other members of this group, like _Euglena gracilis_, are free-living.

**Excavata** includes organisms that do not have mitochondria. These include important pathogens such as _Giardia lamblia_. Normally, an individual ingests some of the infective cysts. When these reach the intestine, the trophozoite form emerges and reproduces, causing diarrhea. During growth, some of the cells re-encyst and are passed back into the environment with the feces. Trophozoites are unable to grow outside of the intestine, so those that pass out with the feces quickly die. A second example is _Trichomonas vaginalis_, which can cause vaginal infections. This organism has no cyst stage. Instead, the trophozoite form is directly transmitted by physical contact.

**Microsporidia** \(Opisthokonta\) comprise another group of non-motile protozoa. These potential pathogens apparently lack both microtubules and mitochondria. Like the Oomycetes, this group of organisms is now thought to be more related to the fungi than protists.

**Instructions**

Observe each of the five commercially prepared protozoa slides using your oil immersion objective.

In addition, you should observe the live \(non-pathogenic\) _Paramecium caudatum_ and _Amoeba proteus_ cultures with wet mounts.

· Use a toothpick to put a dab of petroleum jelly on the corners of a two coverslips.

· Put a drop of one culture in the center of a microscope slide.

· Place a the coverslips so that the culture is covered and centered.

· View using your either 100X or 400X \(you will want to reduce the brightness of the light using the iris in the substage condenser\).

· Try to determine which of the cultures \(if any\) is more motile.



**Notebook Entry**

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.



✪ **Observations**

• Carefully record the size, shape, arrangement, and color of the cells in your samples. Search around your slides and make sure that you see examples of all seven protozoa.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1\) Record the view of the ocular micrometers and microbial cells in focus for each of the seven different samples. Make sure that you clearly label your samples.

2\) Using the panels below, draw an accurate representation of each sample. Make sure that you label each sample well. Also ensure that your drawings show the correct size, shape, arrangement, and color of each cell type.







✪ **Conclusions**

1\) Which of these is the largest in size? Which is the smallest?

2\) What diseases \(if any\) are associated with each of these protists?

3\) What phylogenetic groups do each of these protist belong to?



**Housekeeping**

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

**Glass waste**

Dispose of your non-pathogenic protozoa slides in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. **Do not **put anything sharp into the regular trash.

**Commercial Slides**

Do not throw the commercial slides or the hanging drop slides away! Wipe any immersion oil off of the slides using a Kimwipe. Then return the slide to the correct slide box. Return the hanging drop slides to the indicated container for later cleaning.

**Bacterial cultures**

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. _Paramecium caudatum_ \(BSL-1\). This is a common ciliate from pond water.

2. _Amoeba proteus_ \(BSL-1\) This is a common amoeba from pond water.

**Compound light microscope**

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X \(red striped, scan\) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.

**Contaminated materials**

We should not contaminate anything today. If you do, however, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

**Laboratory bench**

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount \(a few milliliters\) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

**Cell phone \/ camera**

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

**Hand washing**

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today \(and _**every day**_\) in the lab.
