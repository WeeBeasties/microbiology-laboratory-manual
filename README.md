# Welcome!

>_This project is currently being assembled and cleaned up. Sorry for the mess._

This is a free and open source Microbiology laboratory manual. It has been developed by Dr. Clifton Franklund at [Ferris State University](http://www.ferris.edu).

## Get the files for yourself

When this is completed, I will share the final notebook project in PDF, eBook, and MOBI formats on my [website](http://franklund-micro.com). I may consider using the Amazon and Apple bookstores to share these for free as well.  

The source documents (all [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files) can be found in a public GitHub repo at [https://github.com/WeeBeasties/microbiology-laboratory-manual](https://github.com/WeeBeasties/microbiology-laboratory-manual). Feel free to fork my repo and modify these files to better reflect your own microbiology course.  

In addition, all of the figures in this laboratory manual have been placed in a public FigShare repository at [https:\/\/figshare.com\/projects\/Microbiology\_Laboratory\_Manual\/15366](https://figshare.com/projects/Microbiology_Laboratory_Manual/15366).
