>_This project is currently being assembled and cleaned up. Sorry for the mess. I hope to have this work finished by early 2017..._

Welcome everyone. This project is a free (as in pizza) and open source Microbiology laboratory manual. It has been developed by [Dr. Clifton Franklund](http://franklund-micro.com) at [Ferris State University](http://www.ferris.edu). This suite of over 30 laboratory exercises was created the fundamentals of General Microbiology and the skill of keeping a laboratory notebook. You can view or download this book in HTML, PDF, MOBI, or ePUB formats from this site. If you read this manual online, you can make comments on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis. Let me know if you find any inaccuracies, errors, or formatting issues.

### Get the files for yourself

Microbiologists tend to do very similar labs. However, there are important variations in how we all do our work. Some labs have students use gloves, others do not. Some labs use incinerators while others use bunsen burners. There can also be variations in the types of microscopes, media, and microbial strains that are used. Therefore, other instructors are likely going to want to modify this book for their own use.  To facilitate the sharing of laboratory exercises, all of the source documents (each one a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file) can be found in a public GitHub repo at:


>[https://github.com/WeeBeasties/microbiology-laboratory-manual](https://github.com/WeeBeasties/microbiology-laboratory-manual). 


Please feel free to fork my repo and modify these files to better reflect your own microbiology course. You can also reorder, delete, or add additional exercises to your copy. If you wish, you can submit a Pull request to have your modifications considered for inclusion in this work. Using [GitBook](http://www.gitbook.com), you can also publish your modified version and share it with your students for no charge with on own account.

In addition, all of the figures in this laboratory manual were created by me and are being placed in a public FigShare repository at:
