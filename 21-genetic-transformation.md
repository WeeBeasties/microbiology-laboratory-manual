Genetic Transformation

Background

Bacteria can horizontally transfer genes (within the parental generation) in at least three different ways – transformation, conjugation, and transduction. Genetic transformation was the first of these to be described and is still an important tool in recombinant DNA laboratories. This process was first described by Frederic Griffith in the 1920s. He was working with two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae – a “rough” strain that made small compact colonies on lab media and a “smooth” strain that made larger mucoid colonies. When injected into mice, the following results were observed.

The rough strain was avirulent to when injected into mice. The smooth strain, however, efficiently killed mice and could be isolated from the mice postmortem (Koch’s postulates). Heat killing the smooth strain made them non-toxic (no real surprise there…). The interesting thing was this: mixing the dead smooth strain with the live rough strain killed the injected mice. Neither of these were virulent when injected individually. Even more strange – live smooth bacteria were isolated from the dead mice. Something had transformed the rough strain into a smooth strain. Oswald Avery proved that the transforming material was DNA in the 1940’s.

It turns out the some bacteria are capable of transporting exogenous DNA into the cell and incorporating it into their genomes. Such cells are called competent. Streptococcus pneumoniae happens to be naturally competent. Other bacteria, like Escherichia coli, are not naturally competent but can be made competent artificially in the laboratory. The point of today’s exercise is to explore competence with a different bacterium: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus.

Instructions

We will be using two strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in this exercise: one is susceptible to the antibiotic streptomycin while the other is resistant. These correspond to Griffith’s rough and smooth strains, respectively.

Day one:

You will first need to heat kill some of the resistant strain.

· Get a tube of saline citrate SDS buffer and label the cap with a unique symbol.

· Flame a loop and add a loopful of the resistant strain to the buffer.

· Place your tightly capped tube in a 60°C water bath for at least 45 minutes.

The combination of detergent (SDS), osmolarity, and temperature will efficiently kill and lyse the resistant cells – releasing their DNA genomes into the solution. After your heat treatment is complete, recover your tube of buffer.

Obtain a plate of nutrient agar and label the bottom with your initial and section number. Then divide the bottom into quarters as indicated below.

· Flame your loop and let it cool. Then streak two loopfuls of the heat-killed resistant strain into each of the “3” and “4” quadrants. Flame and cool your loop between each transfer.

· Flame your loop again and let it cool. Streak the live resistant strain in quarter “1”.

· Flame your loop again and let it cool. Now streak the live susceptible strain in each of the “2” and “4” quarters. Flame and cool your loop between each transfer.

Incubate your plate, bottoms-up, in the 35°C incubator.

Day two:

Observe the growth (or lack of it) in the four quarters of your plate. Obtain another plate of nutrient agar. This time, your plates will contain the antibiotic streptomycin. Label these plates exactly the same way as before.

· Flame your loop and let it cool. Then streak a small quantity of the growth from quarter “1” of your original plate into quarter “1” of the streptomycin plate.

· Repeat this process for the other three quadrants.

Incubate your plate, bottoms-up, in the 35°C incubator.

Day three:

Observe the growth (or lack of it) in the four quarters of your plate.

Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ Observations

• Carefully record the growth on all four quarters of each of your plates. Indicate clearly which plate is which!

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1) Carefully sketch your observations by hand and label each plate and quarter.

2) Photograph each plate, print the pictures and tape them into your notebook. Once again, be sure to clearly label your photos.

✪ Conclusions

1. For each quarter (1-4) of the nutrient agar plate, explain why bacterial growth was or was not present.

2. For each quarter (1-4) of the streptomycin agar plate, explain why bacterial growth was or was not present.

3. Which step of Griffith’s transformation experiment corresponds to each of our plate quarters?

Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (BSL-2). This microbe is commonly found in soil and is also present in the gut contents of humans and some mosquitoes.

Return the cultures when you have completed your inoculations.

Contaminated materials

Your tubes of heat killed bacteria should be disposed of in the unlined silver buckets. When you have finished observing your plates, they should be discarded in the orange bag lined silver buckets. If you spill any of the cultures today, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
