## Background

We are using Swift M7000 binocular compound light microscopes in our microbiology laboratories. This document pertains to the proper use of our particular microscopes. You are responsible for all of the material covered in both this document and any other reading assigned by your laboratory instructor.

## **Major parts of the M7000 microscope:**

The essential parts of our microscopes are labeled to the left. All compound microscopes share most of these features. Note that our microscopes have two 10X ocular lenses \(binocular\). This make viewing more comfortable, but requires a few extra adjustments to be fully appreciated. The function of each component will be described below:

1. **Ocular lenses**: The eye pieces – each has a magnifying power of 10X.
2. **Cord wrap**: Brackets to store the power cord around when done using the scope.
3. **Objective lenses**: Secondary lenses to magnify the sample – these range from 4X to 100X.
4. **Course focus knob**: Used to rapidly move the stage \(an sample\) to focus.
5. **Fine focus knob**: Used to tweak the focus – use this with the 40X and 100X objectives.
6. **Mechanical stage controls**: Move the sample in the X and Y planes. Focus is the Z plane.
7. **Condenser iris**: This lever controls how much light passes through your sample.
8. **Power switch**: Turns the lamp on and off.
9. **Light source**: A halogen lamp.

## **Procedure for taking out and using the microscope:**

1. Go to the microscope cabinet and get the scope that was assigned to you. Carry it carefully back to your bench using two hands \(one holding the arm of the scope and one under the base\).

2. Unwrap the power cord and plug in the microscope.

3. Make sure that the 4X objective is pointed down and that the stage is as far away from the objective as possible.

4. Turn on the lamp.

5. Adjust the condenser iris lever to regulate the degree of illumination.

6. Set the interpupillary distance between the ocular lenses. When set correctly, you will comfortably see a single circular field of view as you look through the eyepieces. This is accomplished by gently pushing the ocular lenses together or apart while viewing through them. When you get them right, note the setting on the adjustment scale. The next time that you use a microscope, you can quickly set up the interpupillary distance using your prior measurement.

7. Place the slide with your specimen \(right side up!\) onto the stage and carefully secure with the spring-loaded slide holder.

8. Use the mechanical stage controls to center your specimen in the illuminated area over the condenser.

9. Double-check that the 4X objective is pointed down toward your sample.

10. While viewing through the ocular lenses, use the coarse focus knobs \(black\) to quickly bring the slide into focus. Adjust the degree of illumination using the condenser iris lever.

11. Now close your left eye. While viewing with your right eye, use the fine focus knobs \(red\) to bring the specimen into sharp focus. You should see the ocular reticle \(measuring scale\) in the right eyepiece.

12. Next, close your right eye. While viewing with your left eye, use the diopter adjustment to bring the specimen into sharp focus. Rotating the left ocular lens does this. The diopter adjustment makes allowances for the fact that your vision in your left and right eyes is probably not the same.

  Now you are ready to use the other objective lenses. Our microscopes have four different objectives lenses. These allow you to view objects at a variety of different magnifications. Our microscope objectives are **parfocal** and **parcentered**. This means that once the sample is centered and focused with one objective, it will be \(more or less\) focused and centered for all of the other objectives too. Please note that the **total magnification** achieved is the product of the ocular lens \(10X\) and the objective lens. As magnification increases, the **field of view** \(total area of the sample that you can see\) decreases. But even more important is the fact that as the magnification increases the **working distance** \(space between the objective lens and the sample\) decreases. _For this reason, you should use only the fine focus to adjust your microscope from this point on_.

13. Rotate the objective turret so that the 10X objective points toward your sample and adjust the focus using the fine focus knobs \(red\). You may use the mechanical stage knobs to re-center your specimen in the field of view. Note that the microscope inverts the image \(? appears as ¿ – if you don’t believe me, use try moving your mechanical stage while viewing the letter e slide\). As a consequence, when you move the stage left, the image appears to move right. This takes some getting used to.

14. Now rotate the objective turret so that the 40X objective points toward your sample and adjust the focus using the fine focus knobs \(red\). You may use the mechanical stage knobs to re-center your specimen in the field of view. This is enough magnification to begin to see the shape and arrangement of prokaryotic cells.

15. Finally, rotate the objective turret so that the 100X objective points toward your sample. You will need to place a drop of immersion oil onto your slide to use this objective. _Do not get oil on the other objective lenses!_ Then adjust the focus using the fine focus knobs \(red\). You may use the mechanical stage knobs to re-center your specimen in the field of view. This is the highest magnification that we can achieve in our labs – you should be able to clearly see the size and arrangement of bacterial cells.


## **Calibrating and making measurements using the microscope:**

Your right ocular lens should have a measuring reticle \(scale\) with 100 unit-less divisions. These marks can be used to estimate the size of microbes and other structures. However, in order to accurately measure objects, we first need to calibrate – standardize – the reticle divisions. To this, we will use a special slide with a stage micrometer. These slides have a line etched on them that is **1 mm \(1,000 µm\)** long and divided into 100 equal segments \(**10 µm each**\). You will focus on this line using each of your objective lenses in turn. By aligning the scales, you can determine how many ocular divisions correspond to how many slide divisions. For example: in the image to the right, 30 ocular divisions spans 2o divisions on the stage micrometer scale. Since each stage micrometer division is 10 µm, that makes 20 X 10 µm = 200 µm. This is then divided by the number of ocular divisions 200 µm ÷ 30 = 6.7 µm per division. Now if you use this object lens and observe a diatom to be 12 divisions long, you can estimate its length to be 12 X 6.7 = about 80 µm. The apparent size of each division will vary as you adjust the total magnification of the microscope.

## **Procedure for putting away the microscope:**

When you have finished observing with your microscope, complete these steps before putting it back into the cabinet.

1. Rotate the objective nosepiece so that the 4X objective points toward your stage.

2. Remove your slide \(if one is present\) from the mechanical stage.

3. Carefully wipe any immersion oil off of the 100X objective _using lens paper_ \(ONLY!\).

4. Use the coarse focus knobs \(black\) to lower the stage as much as possible.

5. Turn off the power to the substage lamp.

6. Unplug the microscope and wrap the electric cord up in the provided location on the microscope arm assembly.

7. Carry the microscope carefully back to the cabinet using two hands \(one holding the arm of the scope and one under the base\).

8. Place your microscope back into the correct cubby.


Immersion oil may be removed from commercially prepared microscope slides using Kimwipes. These slides should be returned to where you found them.

Any microscope slides that you have prepared in lab can be disposed of in the glass waste box.

**DO NOT** put the microscope away with oil on the lenses or slides still on the stage! I will give a warning for the first improper use and storage of our microscopes. Thereafter, I will deduct laboratory points.

## **Instructions**

Focus on the stage micrometer with each of your microscopes objective lenses. Align the ocular reticle with the stage micrometer and illustrate the relative spacing. Using this information, **determine the relative size of each ocular reticle division** \(in µm\) for your microscope.

The entire ocular reticle \(all 100 divisions\) spans 56% of the field of view. Using this information, **calculate the total field of view for each of your objective lenses**. Also, use a ruler to **measure the working distance for each objective** \(this is the distance between your objective lens and the surface of the slide when in focus\).

Use an appropriate calibrated objective lens to measure the width of the letter “e” on the prepared slide.

Also estimate the width of the line making up the letter. Draw what you see…



**Notebook Entry**

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ **Observations**

• Record the view of the stage micrometer and ocular micrometers in focus for each of your objectives.

• Record the view of the letter e slide at an appropriate magnification.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1\) Photograph the view through your right ocular with your digital camera, print the picture, tape it into your lab notebook and label it appropriately.

2\) Using the panels below, draw a black bar beneath the ocular scale and indicate how many stage division it represents. For example, if 12 stage divisions equaled 40 ocular divisions, the black bar should extend from 0 to 4 and be labeled “12”. Draw the letter e to scale against the ocular divisions.

Calculate the size of an ocular division at each magnification and the dimensions of the letter e \(show your calculations\).

✪ **Conclusions**

Answer the following questions and complete this data table.

1\) How did the letter “e” appear when you look directly at the slide? How did it appear when viewed through your microscope?

2\) How wide was the letter “e” \(in µm\)?

3\) How wide is the letter “e” line \(in µm\)?



| Objective | Magnification | Working Distance | Field of View | Division Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4X |  |  |  |  |
| 10X |  |  |  |  |
| 40X |  |  |  |  |
| 100X |  |  |  |  |



**Housekeeping**

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

**Glass waste**

There should be no glass waste today. However, you should now know where to dispose of broken glass in the lab.

**Compound light microscope**

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X \(red striped, scan\) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.

**Commercial Slides**

Do not throw the commercial slides away! Wipe any immersion oil off of the slides using a Kimwipe. Then return the slide to the correct slide box.

**Laboratory bench**

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount \(a few milliliters\) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

**Cell phone \/ camera**

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

**Hand washing**

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today \(and _**every day**_\) in the lab.
