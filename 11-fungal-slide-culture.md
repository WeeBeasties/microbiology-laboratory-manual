# Exercise 11

## Fungal Slide Culture

### Background

The fungi are a group of eukaryotic microbes that can exist as single-celled or multicellular forms. Single celled fungi are referred to as yeast, while the multicellular forms are called molds, mildews, or even mushrooms. The cell wall of fungi is composed of chitin, a type of polysaccharide. The fungal membrane differs from ours in the sort of sterol that is incorporated; we use cholesterol in our membranes while the fungi use ergosterol.

The vast majority of all fungi are saprophytes. This is, they live by decomposing dead organisms. Due to their cell wall, fungi cannot use phagocytosis to take up their food. Instead, they secrete a variety of exoenzymes to break down larger molecules before transporting the smaller subunits into their cells. A few fungi can cause infections (called mycoses). These are usually limited to localized skin infections. Systemic infections by fungi are rare (and usually fatal).

The Kingdom Fungi consists of the Divisions Chytridomycota, Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. The latter three groups are primarily terrestrial and all were mentioned in lecture. The scientists that study these organisms are called mycologists.

Multicellular fungi grow as filamentous structure termed a hyphae. In most fungi, hyphae are the main mode of vegetative growth, and are collectively called a mycelium. The hypha consists of one or more cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. In most fungi, hyphae are divided into cells by internal cross-walls called septa. These hyphae are called septate. Septa are usually perforated by pores large enough organelles to flow between cells. Other fungi have aseptate hyphae, meaning their hyphae are not partitioned by septa. These are called coenocytic.

Viewing the a fungal mycelium with a microscope is difficult. The fungal mass is three-dimensional and our microscopes have a very limited focal plane. To make observations easier, we will perform fungal slide cultures. The point of the exercise is to coerce the fungi to grow as a thin layer to facilitate our observations later.

### Instructions

You will work in groups of four for this exercise. Each person will receive a different coded fungal specimen. Each student will set up their own fungal slide culture as follows:

· Get an empty sterile petri dish and label the cover with your initials, section number, and fungal code number.

· Get a glass “V”, disinfect it using an alcohol wipe and place it in the dish using a forceps.

· Get a clean microscope slide, disinfect it by briefly flaming, and place it on top of the glass “V”.

· Obtain a piece of potato dextrose agar (approx. 1 cm x 1 cm) from your lab instructor and place it in the center of your microscope slide.

· Sterilize a teasing needle by flaming and allow it to cool. Inoculate the sides of the agar block. Re-sterilize the needle and return it.

· Finally, cover the agar block with a clean cover slip. You may disinfect it by briefly (very briefly) flaming.

· Add a small puddle of water (a few ml) to the dish in the space beneath your slide. Do not get water on your sample.

· Place your petri dish in the 20°C (room temperature) incubator and allow to grow for one week.



You will observe the fungi using your 40X objective after the cultures have grown.

· Get a clean slide and apply one drop of lactophenol cotton blue stain.

· Use a forceps to lift the coverslip off of your fungal culture.

· Place the coverslip right-side up onto the drop of stain.

· View your fungi with your light microscope.

· If the coverslip breaks, remove the agar block from your culture slide.

· Add a drop of lactophenol cotton blue stain where the block used to be.

· Cover the stain with a clean coverslip and view using your microscope.



### Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.  

**✪ Observations**

• Carefully record the size, shape, arrangement, and color of the cells in your samples. Search around your slides and make sure that you see both the hyphae and any asexual spores.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1) Record the view of the ocular micrometers and fungal cells in focus for each of the eight different samples. Make sure that you clearly label your samples.

2) Using the panels below, draw an accurate representation of each sample. Make sure that you label each sample well. Also ensure that your drawings show the correct size, shape, arrangement, and color of each cell type.









✪ Conclusions

1) Which fungus was associated with each of the numbers in your group? 

2) Which of the four fungal divisions does each of your fungi belong to? 

3) What type of asexual spores did you see for each fungus? 

4) Why type of hyphae did each fungus have (septate/coenocytic)?





Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

Dispose of your slides and coverslips in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash. Do not throw the glass Vs away.

Fungal cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. Rhizopus stolonifer (BSL-1). This is black bread mold.

2. Syncephalastrum racemosum (BSL-1) A common soil fungus.

3. Penicillium chrysogenum (BSL-1). This microbe makes penicillin and can be found in blue cheese.

4. Fusarium verticillioides (BSL-1) Another fairly common soil fungus.

Compound light microscope

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X (red striped, scan) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.

Contaminated materials

Dispose of your petri dishes in the cans lined with an orange bag.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
