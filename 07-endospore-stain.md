### Background

Bacterial endospores are survival cells. Some soil bacteria that are members of the Firmicutes \(primarily in the genus _Bacillus_ and _Clostridium_\) readily form them under adverse conditions. Endospores are produced in a form of cellular differentiation in response to starvation conditions. Once formed, endospores can withstand chemical agents, antibiotics, heating, cold, and even some exposure to radiation. Unfortunately, they are also resistant to staining. Today we will perform our second differential stain to visualize these structures. The procedure for the stain is shown below and is a modification of the original method devised by Dorner in 1922. In our stain today, we are going to use the heat of a steam bath to drive the primary stain \(malachite green\) into the tough endospore walls. Once stained, the spores are very difficult to destain. Therefore - unlike the Gram stain - , you may apply the water colorization step for as long as you like.

### **Instructions**

One person in your pair will stain a sample of _Bacillus cereus_ today from two kinds of media, Brain Heart Infusion Agar (BHIA) and Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA). One of these media is _much_ richer in nutrients than the other. Your can stain both preparations on one microscope slide. For each culture, you should perform the following steps:

• Put a loop of water on one slide of a clean microscope slide.

• Flame sterilize a loop and add a small quantity of the _Bacillus cereus_ culture.

• Allow the sample to air dry and heat fix.

• Perform the steps of the endospore stain from the previous table.

• Blot dry with bibulous paper.

• View your specimens using the oil immersion objective.

### **Notebook Entry**

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.



✪ **Observations**

• Carefully record the size, shape, arrangement, and color of the cells in your samples. Search around your slide and make sure that you see both the vegetative cells and the endospores.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1\) Record the view of the ocular micrometers and bacterial cells in focus for each of the eight different samples. Make sure that you clearly label your samples.

2\) Using the panels below, draw an accurate representation of each sample. Make sure that you label each sample well. Also ensure that your drawings show the correct size, shape, arrangement, and color of each cell type.







✪ **Conclusions**

1. What color would these vegetative cells be in the Gram stain?

2. List three diseases that are associated with endospore-forming \(your may need to refer to the internet or your textbook.

3. Since boiling is insufficient to kill all endospores, how do we eliminate them from our laboratory media and equipment?

4. Was there a difference in the endospore formation on these media? If so, what might account for this difference.

**Housekeeping**

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

**Glass waste**

Dispose of your microscope slides in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. **Do not **put anything sharp into the regular trash.

**Bacterial cultures**

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. _Bacillus cereus_ \(BSL-1\). This is a common soil microbe. It forms endospores.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your stains.

**Compound light microscope**

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X \(red striped, scan\) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.

**Contaminated materials**

We should not contaminate anything today. If you do, however, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

**Laboratory bench**

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount \(a few milliliters\) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

**Cell phone \/ camera**

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

**Hand washing**

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today \(and _**every day**_\) in the lab.
