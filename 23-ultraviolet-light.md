Ultraviolet Light

Background

The electromagnetic spectrum consists of radiation ranging from very short to very long wavelengths (see the illustration below). In general, shorter wavelength radiation has more energy, has a higher frequency, has greater penetrating power, and is more biologically damaging than longer wavelength radiation. We are most familiar with visible light (wavelength 400 to 700 nm). Ultraviolet light has a shorter wavelength than visible light. As a result, UV light has more energy than visible light and can be used as a germicidal treatment.

Ultraviolet radiation is broken into three sub-spectra (A, B, and C). UVA has wavelengths between 315 and 400 nm. These are the wavelengths that give you a suntan and are the least damaging. UVA is partially removed from the solar spectrum by the ozone in our atmosphere. UVB has wavelengths from 280 to 315 nm. These wavelengths are more damaging and cause sunburns and skin cancer. Most, but not all, of the UVB portion of the solar radiation is removed by ozone. The shortest wavelength UV light (UVC; 100 to 280 nm) is the most damaging. These wavelengths are completely removed from sunlight by ozone in our atmosphere. We can, however, produce these wavelengths using special bulbs – like the small ones we use in this lab or the larger ones that you will see at the wastewater treatment plant later.

Ultraviolet light is most germicidal around 260 nm. DNA strongly absorbs energy at this frequency and that leads to DNA damage. One common form of DNA damage is the formation of pyrimidine dimers (see picture to the right). The extra bonds between the pyrimidine bases prevents proper base pairing in the double stranded DNA. The repair process involved in resolving this situation is error-prone. Errors due to UV exposure result in mutations of the DNA sequence. If enough mutations accumulate, the cell will die. We will compare the relative susceptibilities of four bacteria to UV exposure today.



Instructions

Working in groups, we will expose four different microbes to different amounts of UV light. Each group should have a tube of one of the organisms, a UV light, an exposure template, 8 small petri dishes of media, and 8 sterile cotton swabs.

We will perform the exposures under subdued lighting. Some strains of bacteria can perform photo-repair (they have a DNA repair enzyme that uses visible light to repair UV damage).

· Plug in your UV light and turn the power on. DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE LIT BULB; your eyes do not like UV light. Let the lamp warm up for at least five minutes.

· Label the bottom of each plate with the name of your organism, you group’s identification, and the eight time points (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, and 90 seconds).

· Dip a cotton swab in your culture and inoculate the surface of your agar media using a 3 + 1 streaking technique (repeat for all eight plates).

· Set the 0 seconds (unexposed plate aside for now).

· Place the 5 second plate right-side-up in the smaller circle on your exposure template.

· Remove the cover from the 5 second plate and place the UV light in the larger circle on your exposure template.

· After 5 seconds, remove the lamp and replace the cover on the 5 second plate. Set it aside with the unexposed plate.

· Repeat this process for the other plates adjusting the exposure time as appropriate.

· When you are finished, place all of your plates bottoms up as a stack in the 20°C (room temperature) incubator.



Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ Observations

• To the best of your ability, determine the number of CFU on each of your 8 plates.

• Plot your data points on the semi-log plots provided (get the other group’s data to complete your entry.

Effect of Ultraviolet Light

Bacillus cereus

Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Serratia marcescens

Staphylococcus aureus

✪ Conclusions

1. Which microbe was most resistant to UV light killing?

2. What accounts for this resistance?

3. Predict what would have happened if we left the covers on the petri dishes while the cells were exposed to UV light.



Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash.

Ultraviolet lamps

When you are finished, wrap up the power cord around the neck of the UV lamps and return them to the front of the lab.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. Bacillus cereus (BSL-1). This is a common endospore-forming bacterium from the soil.

2. Serratia marcescens (BSL-1) This gamma proteobacteria produces a red pigment and is very rarely pathogenic.

3. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (BSL-2) This is commonly found in wet environments and can be a potent pathogen under the right circumstances.

4. Staphylococcus aureus (BSL-2) This is commonly found on your skin and in your nose.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your stains.

Contaminated materials

Dispose of your used cotton swabs in the silver cans lined with an orange biohazard bag. At the end of this exercise, you should dispose of your petri dishes in the orange bags as well. If you spill a culture, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
