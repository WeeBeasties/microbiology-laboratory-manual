Exoenzymes

Background

In catabolism, macromolecules are hydrolyzed to smaller molecules that can then be transported into cells for use as building blocks (as is usually the case with amino acids and nucleotides) or used as an energy source. The enzymes that catalyze these reactions are secreted from bacteria and therefore are considered "exoenzymes", i.e. they function outside the cell. Some important virulence factors of extracellular pathogenic bacteria are also exoenzymes. The following tests examine the production of specific classes of exoenzymes.

Amylase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes starch (amylose), a polymer of glucose, into monomers that can then be transported into cells. After two days of bacterial growth on starch agar, the plate is flooded with Gram's iodine, which reacts with the remaining starch in the medium to yield a brown color. If bacteria have degraded the starch in the medium a clear zone will be observed around the bacteria. In some cases, the bacteria may produce or store starch, in which case the bacteria will actually stain darkly.

Interpretation: after adding Gram's iodine

clear zone in medium = + ;

no clear zone = -

DNase activity refers to the ability of bacteria to hydrolyze DNA in the growth medium to its component nucleotides. Presumably, these organisms would also secrete a phosphatase to convert the nucleotides to nucleosides for transport into the cells. After two days of bacterial growth on DNA agar, the plate is flooded with 1 M HCl, which causes the DNA to come out of solution and turn the medium opaque. A clear zone around the colonies indicates that the DNA has been hydrolyzed.

Interpretation: after adding 1 M HCl

clear zone in medium =

no clear zone = -

Gelatinase activity hydrolyzes gelatin - a protein produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from animal tissues. Collagen has an unusual amino acid composition that makes it resistant to many proteases, and thus an organism may secrete proteases that hydrolyze casein, while not exhibiting gelatinase activity. After two days of bacterial growth, the culture is placed into an ice bucket to chill. If the medium does not resolidify (gel), then the organism has hydrolyzed the gelatin.

Interpretation: after chilling on ice

culture remains liquid = +

culture gels = -

Lipase activity refers to the ability of certain bacteria to hydrolyze triglycerides to glycerol and fatty acids. Tributyrin (glycerol esterified to three butyric acids) emulsified with Polysorbate (Tween) 80 in a base medium. If lipase is present, the medium around the bacteria will become less opaque. You will be looking for the presence of a halo around the growth.

Interpretation:

Clear zone = +

No change in medium = -

Instructions

Working in groups of four, you will inoculate media to test for each of the four exoenzymes.

Day one: obtain one plate each for amylase, DNase, and lipase.

· Divide the plates into four quarters and label the quarters for the four microbes (e.g. BC, EC, PA, and SA).

· Flame a loop and let it cool. Use the loop to make a simple streak (just one stripe) of each organism in each labeled quarter.

· Obviously, you should re-flame your loop between streaks.

· Incubate the plates (bottoms up) at 35°C.

· Obtain one gelatin tube for each culture.

· Label them with the organism name and your group’s symbol.

· Stab them with one loop of culture and incubate them at 35°C.

Day two:

· Treat each of your media as required (see above).

· Determine which microbes produced which exoenzymes.

· Record your results in your lab notebook.



Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.



✪ Observations

• Carefully record the appearance of all of your exoenzyme tests. You may record these data in one of two ways:

1) Photograph your media and tape the pictures into your notebook. Make sure that you clearly label all of your media and microbes.



✪ Conclusions

1. Which of these exoenzymes would most likely be involved in virulence in humans? Explain.

2. Which microbes produced which exoenzymes? Provide a table of results.

Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. Escherichia coli (BSL-1). The K12 strain is the most studied organism on the planet.

2. Clostridium sporogenes (BSL-1) This is basically Clostridium botulinum without toxins.

3. Staphylococcus aureus (BSL-2) This is commonly found on your skin and in your nose.

4. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (BSL-2) This is commonly found in wet environments and can be a potent pathogen under the right circumstances.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your stains.

Contaminated materials

You should dispose of your gelatin tubes in the unlined silver cans when you have completed your observations. The petri dishes should all be placed in the orange bap-lined silver buckets when you are done. If you spill any cultures, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
