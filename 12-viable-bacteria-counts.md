# Exercise 12

## Viable Bacteria Counts

### Background

A common means of estimating the number of microbes in a liquid sample is to plate several known dilutions on agar plates and count the number of resulting colonies. A related method is used to enumerate viruses by counting plaques on a lawn of susceptible host cells. In either case, by finding one or more plates with a countable number of colonies, we may calculate the number of microbes present in the original stock. Typically, microbiologists seek plates with between 30 and 300 colonies or plaques. These numbers allow for statistical significance while still enable accurate counting of discrete and separate colonies. I refer to plates with 30-300 colonies “countable plates”. For our stripes, a countable number would be between 10 and 30. An example of a dilution series is shown below.

In a dilution series, the original microbial suspension is sequentially reduced in several steps. Some people find the calculation of dilutions a little intimidating. Therefore, I will break this mathematic process down into a few simple parts. The first thing to consider is how much dilution is accomplished at each individual step of the serial dilution. The dilution factors of each step may be calculated for any volumes using the tube dilution factor (TDF) formula shown below.

In the dilution series illustrated above, each of the tubes has the same dilution factor. Namely…

The series dilution factor (SDF) for any tube is merely the product of all tube dilution factors up to, and including that tube.

Simply put, the SDF for tube C is 10 • 10 • 10 or 1,000. Note that when you multiply exponential numbers with the same base, you add the exponents (10<sup>1</sup> • 10<sup>1</sup> • 10<sup>1</sup> = 10<sup>3</sup>).

The final dilution factor accounts for the fact that we often use more or less than one milliliter from our dilution tubes to inoculate the agar plates. If we choose to use an entire milliliter, this factor would be the same as the SDF. To account for the amount plated, we simply divide the SDF by the volume (in milliliters) used to inoculate the plate. As you can see in our example, each plate was inoculated with 0.1 ml so we would need to divide by that factor - x/0.1 (which is equivalent to 10X). Please note that the unit on the FDF is ml-1 (read this as per milliliter). The other dilution factors do not have units. The final dilution then, is simply the following.

The FDF for plate “C” in our example is 1,000/0.1 ml = 10,000 ml-1 or 104 ml-1. Likewise, the final dilution for plates A and B are 102 ml-1 and 103 ml-1, respectively. We can now estimate the number of bacteria in our original culture using the final dilution factor for the plate giving a countable number of colonies (or plaques). The microbial estimate is the calculated as follows:

We can also do the opposite calculations – that is, given an approximation for the CFU/ml in a particular flask, we can predict the number of colonies (or plaques) that should be found on any plate. Using the illustration on page 1 again, let’s assume that there are about 54,000 cfu/ml in the culture flask. How many colonies should be found on plate “C”? What about “B”? To find these answers, we divide the known CFU/ml by the SDF and multiply by the plated volume. Therefore…

### Instructions

We will work in groups of four (pods) again today. Each group will perform duplicate dilutions of a bacterial culture to determine the number of cfu/ml. To do this, you will perform the following steps.

· Obtain a suspension of Staphylococcus aureus to enumerate.

· We are going to use microtiter plates to set up six 10-1 dilutions.

· Pour about 10 ml of sterile saline into a pipetting tray.

· Put six sterile micropipette tips on a multichannel pipetter (don’t contaminate them with your fingers!)

· Transfer 135µl of saline (50µl + 50µl + 35µl) to 2 empty rows of wells as indicated below.

· Dispose of the used tips in a white plastic cup.

· Use a single channel pipetter to transfer 15µl of the bacterial suspension to the first dilution well.

· Mix by gently flushing in and out three times with the pipetter.

· Push all of the sample out of the pipette tip and remove from the well.

· Discard the contaminated tip into a white plastic cup.

· Use a fresh tip and repeat steps 7-10 but transfer from well 1 to well 2.

· Repeat to well 6.

· Use a second sample of the bacterial suspension to perform a second dilution series.


· Use a fresh set of six sterile pipette tips to transfer 5µl from each of the wells in one of your dilutions series to a plate of media. Let the liquid hang as small drops and touch them off onto the agar surface.

· Immediately tip the plate vertically so that the small drops run in parallel streaks.

· Repeat 14 and 15 with fresh tips and a new plate of media.

· Label the bottoms of your plates with your pod’s symbol, section number, and dilution number. Incubate bottoms up at 35°C

### Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

**✪ Observations**

• Carefully record the general appearance of your plates following incubation. Also record the number of colonies observed in any countable stripes.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1) Draw a detailed picture of your plates’ appearance. Make sure that you clearly label your samples and identify cfu numbers.

2) Take photographs of your plates and include them along with colony counts in your lab notebook.

**✪ Conclusions**

1. What was the tube dilution factor for well 1 in your dilution? Show your calculation.

2. What was the series dilution factor for well 6? Show your calculation.

3. What was the cfu/ml estimate from each of your dilutions? Show your calculations.

4. List three factors that might contribute to variations in the cfu/ml estimates between different groups in your lab section.

### Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

**Glass waste**    

Dispose of any broken glass in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day.

**Bacterial cultures**  

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

* _Staphylococcus aureus_ (**BSL-2**) is a commensal microbe that is commonly found on your skin and in your nose. It is an opportunistic pathogen, so handle it with care.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your dilutions.

**Contaminated materials**  

Dispose of the contaminated micropipette tips in the orange bag-lined silver cans. Return the microtiter plates, sterile diluent, pipets, and unused tips when you are done with your dilutions. When you are finished observing the plates, they too should be disposed of in the orange biohazard bags.

**Laboratory bench**

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

**Cell phone / camera**

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

**Hand washing**

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
