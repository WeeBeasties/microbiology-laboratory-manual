Water Quality Testing

Background

Many important microbial diseases are transmitted via the fecal-oral route. In this mechanism, food or water supplies are contaminated with fecal material of either human or animal origins and directly consumed by people. Hundreds of different pathogens (including helminths, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses) can potentially be present in surface waters. Directly testing for each of these microbes is not feasible – there are just too many possibilities. In addition, many of these are difficult and/or dangerous to cultivate and identify in the laboratory. As an alternative, microbiologists typically use “indicator organisms” to detect possible fecal contamination.

A good indicator organism should have several properties:

1. The organism should always be present when feces are present.

2. The organism should be absent when feces are absent.

3. The organism should be very easy to grow.

4. The organism should be easy to identify (using differential media).

5.The organism should persist in the environment slightly longer than the pathogens (there is less problem with false positives than false negatives).

The most common indicators used to detect fecal contamination are fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci. Fecal coliforms are lactose-fermenting gamma proteobacteria (like Escherichia coli). Coliforms are commonly found in mammalian feces – including humans – and are considered good proxies for detecting potential human fecal contamination. The Department of Environmental Quality has empirically determined coliform levels that correspond to water safety. Our wastewater treatment plant is not allowed to discharge more than 400 fecal coliform cfu/100 ml into our river. The river itself must have fewer than 160 fecal coliform cfu/100 ml to be considered safe for recreational purposes. Drinking water (having the most rigorous standards) must have <1 fecal coliform cfu/100 ml. Knowing that the water is safe or not is good. However, we sometimes would also like to make inferences about the probable source of contamination. That is what the other indicator organism is good for.

Ratio

Probable Source

Blue/Red ≥ 4:1

Human

2:1 ≥ Blue/Red < 4:1

Mixed

0.7:1 ≥ Blue/Red < 2:1

Unknown

Blue/Red < 0.7

Animal

Fecal streptococci – like Enterococcus faecalis – are common in the feces of animals (like ducks) but not humans. By comparing the ratio of coliforms to streptococci, we can make an informed guess as to where the fecal contamination originated. The ratios that we will be using are indicated to the right.

Instructions

We will be evaluating water samples from three different locations at two different dilutions in duplicate (12 stations). The class will divide into twelve pairs – each pair claiming one sample for processing. Each pair will need one plate of two different media: mFC and mEA. The mFC plate is used to detect fecal coliforms. It contains lactose and resorcinol dye. These components make fecal coliform colonies appear blue after incubation. The media also contains bile salts that inhibit the growth of non-coliform bacteria. We will incubate these plates at 44.5°C to prevent the confounding by non-fecal coliforms; environmental coliforms cannot ferment lactose at elevated temperatures. The mEA plate is used to detect fecal streptococci. This media contains the metabolic poison sodium azide. The media also contains tetrazolium red. Any azide-resistant bacteria will grow and turn red as the reduce the tetrazolium dye. The water sample discussed in the introduction are expressed in cfu/100 ml. Our plates are too small to plate that much water! Therefore, we will concentrate our samples by filtration. We will apply 20 ml of your sample to a filter with a pore size of 0.45 µm. That is too small for bacteria to pass through. Once your sample has filtered, we will apply an 80 ml sterile water rinse to remove any inhibitory compounds from the water sample. The filter will be placed grid-side-up onto the surface of the media. After incubation, we will count the number of colonies and calculate both fecal coliforms per 100 ml and the ratios of coliforms to streptococci. The dilution calculation is similar to what we’ve done before.





Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ Conclusions

1. Which of these bodies of water (if any) is safe for recreational use?

2. Which of these bodies of water (if any) is safe for drinking?

3. What is the most probable source of contamination for each of these bodies of water?



Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Contaminated materials

When you have completed your observations, you should discard your mFC and mEA plates in the orange bag-lined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
