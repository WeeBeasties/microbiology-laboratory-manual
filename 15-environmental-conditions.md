Environmental Conditions

Background

Microbes vary tremendously with regard to the environmental conditions that support their optimal growth. As a consequence, nearly every possible niche on Earth is currently populated with microbes. Each of these locations has their own chemical and physical conditions and supports microbes that favor that environment. In today’s exercise, we will examine the affect of three physical parameters on microbial growth.

Temperature: Microbes that grow optimally under cool conditions (0-15°C) are called psychrophiles. Other microbes can tolerate cool conditions, but grow best around room temperature (20°C). These are referred to as psychrotrophs. Most microbial pathogens are mesophiles. These microbes grow best between room temperature and body temperature (20°-40°). Finally – some microbes like it hot. Microbes with optimal growth under high temperatures (>40°C) are called thermophiles.

pH: Microbial growth also varies with respect to the concentration of hydrogen ions in the environment. Remember that pH is the –log[H+]. Microbes that grow best at low pH (1-5) are called acidophiles. Neutrophiles grow best at neutral pH (6-8). Lastly, alkalinophiles are microbes that grow best at alkaline, or high, pH (9-14).

Salt: High osmolarity (lots of solutes) tends to be inhibitory for most microbes. The presence of high salt or sugar concentrations makes the environment hypertonic to the microbial cell. Water, therefore, tends to leave the microbial cell by osmosis resulting in cell death. Most bacteria are inhibited by moderate levels of salt (1-5%). These are termed non-halotolerant. A few microbes can tolerate higher concentrations (1-15%). These are called halotolerant. In contrast, some microbes actually require elevated salt concentrations for growth. These are the halophiles. The difference between a halophilic and halotolerant microbes is that the halotolerant can grow with no added salt. The halophile cannot.

Instructions

Your laboratory section will work in six groups today. Each group will be given one strain of microbe to test. You will evaluate the growth of your microbe at five different temperatures, five different pHs, and five different salt concentrations.

· Obtain the pure culture for your section.

· Get five temperature tubes (unlabeled broth tubes) and label them with your organism’s initials and put a distinctive mark on each cap to make locating your tubes easier in the future. Label the tubes for the temperatures (5, 20, 35, 42, 55).

· Get five pH tubes (labeled P3, P5, P7, P9, and P11) and label them with your organism’s initials and put a distinctive mark on each cap to make locating your tubes easier in the future.

· Get five salt tubes (labeled 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10) and label them with your organism’s initials and put a distinctive mark on each cap to make locating your tubes easier in the future.

· Use a Pasteur pipette to inoculate each of your 15 tubes. Add two drops of your pure culture to each tube.

· Place each of your temperature tubes into an incubator set to the corresponding value. Your lab instructor will tell you where they are.

· All of the pH tubes (except for the Bacillus stearothermophilus) go into the 35°C incubator. The Bacillus stearothermophilus pH tubes should be placed in the 55°C incubator.

· All of the salt tubes (except for the Bacillus stearothermophilus) go into the 35°C incubator. The Bacillus stearothermophilus salt tubes should also be placed in the 55°C incubator.

· After growth has occurred, resuspend your cultures by briefly vortexing.

· Obtain turbidity standards (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4). Shake them to resuspend the particles.

· Compare your cultures to the standards and estimate the turbidity (you can split the difference (i.e. 3.5) if you wish.

· Plot your observed values in the graphs provided.

Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ Observations

1. Record the turbidity for each of your 15 cultures.

2. Gather the data for the other 5 cultures in the lab.

3. Using the panels below, plot your 90 data points and connect with lines.

✪ Conclusions

1. Which microbe(s) was a psychrotroph?

2. Which microbe(s) was a meosphile?

3. Which microbe(s) was a thermophile?

4. Which microbe(s) was an acidophile?

5. Which microbe(s) was a neutrophile?

6. Which microbe(s) was a alkalinophile?

7. Which microbe(s) was halotolerant?

8. Which microbe(s) was non-halotolerant?

Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

Dispose of your Pasteur pipette in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. Alkaligenes faecalis (BSL-1) A common environmental microbe that was first isolated from feces. It is abundant in other locations as well.

2. Bacillus stearothermophilus (BSL-1) A common endospore-forming soil bacterium.

3. Escherichia coli (BSL -1) The K12 strain is the most studies life form on Earth

4. Pseudomonas fluorescens (BSL-1) A common environmental isolate; rarely pathogenic

5. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (BSL-1) This is common baker’s or brewer’s yeast.

6. Staphylococcus aureus (BSL-2) This is commonly found on your skin and in your nose.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your inoculations.

Contaminated materials

All of your culture tubes should be placed in the unlined buckets at the front of the lab.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
