Bacterial Growth Curve

Background

There are many ways to measure the growth of bacteria: direct cell counts, viable cell counts, protein determinations, etc. One of the most common techniques used in the lab, though, is spectrophotometry. Basically, this involves measuring the turbidity (cloudiness) of a bacterial suspension. Bacterial cultures obey Beer’s law.

The absorbance (amount of light scattered) is directly related to three factors.

· The molar extinction coefficient (e) is a constant that describes how much light is scattered per mole of cells. This value is constant is unknown for our cells and is affected by the size, shape, arrangement, and other optical qualities of the culture.

· The path length (L) is a constant that refers to the diameter of our spectrophotometer tubes.

· The concentration (c) is the only variable. As the number of cells increases, the absorbance will also increase.

Spectrophotometry has several advantages – it is fast, easy, and cheap. However, there are several limitations to this technique as well. The cells must be fairly concentrated to be measured (>106 cfu/ml). On the other hand, high density cultures(>109 cfu/ml) are difficult to measure too. Finally, both live and dead bacteria scatter light (so do non-bacterial particles) so turbidity can overestimate viable cell numbers.

The number of cells in a culture growing by binary fission can be calculated using the following formula (where X is the number of cells, Y is the number of doublings, and X0 is the initial number of cells).

We can then do a log transformation of that formula to arrive at this second equation.
   
The value of Y (the number of doublings) is equal to the time elapsed divided by the amount of time necessary for each doubling – the doubling time (g).

Substituting in for Y, we now have…

This is a linear function ( y = mx + b). If we plot the logarithm of cell numbers versus time, the slope of the line will be…

We can calculate the slope (rise over run) from the linear portion (the log phase) of our growth curve using two time points – P1 and P2 as follows:

The growth rate (k) is the number of doublings that take place in a set time (like an hour). It is the reciprocal of the generation – or doubling time.

Time minutes
Absorbance 660 nm
30    0.015
60    0.025
90    0.043
120    0.073
150    0.122
180    0.211
210    0.355
240    0.615

Let’s use this information to examine some practice data. The growth of a bacterial culture was followed for four hours by taking samples every thirty minutes and measuring the absorbance at 660 nm (deep red). The values recorded are given in the table below and are plotted on the next page. Notice how the y-axis appears (it is a log scale and not a linear scale). This semi-log plot is like plotting log(Absorbance) vs. time.

As you can see in this plot, all of the points fall on a line (the cells are in log phase). Therefore, we could use any two points to calculate g and k for this culture – let’s use the first and last points (30 min, 0.015) and (240 min, 0.615). First we calculate m.

Instructions

Six different groups will measure the growth of a simulated microbe, Obnoxious oderium, at one of six growth temperatures. You will need to gather the data from all six groups to complete your notebook entry. The first thing that you need to do is turn on the spectrophotometer at your station and zero it out. Refer to the picture below to perform the following steps.

· Set the filter range to 600 – 950 nm

· Turn the spectrophotometer on by turning knob A.

· Turn the wavelength knob to set the wavelength to 660 nm. Bacteria scatter red light most efficiently.

· With no samples in the meter and in transmission mode, use knob A to set the transmission to 0.00.

· Change the mode to absorbance.

· Resuspend your blank (0), wipe with a Kimwipe, insert into the sample chamber and close the sample lid. (I have the numbers on the tube face toward the front of the machine for consistency sake).

· Zero the absorbance of the blank using knob B.

You are now ready to read each of the growth samples at your station (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes). DO NOT OPEN THESE TUBES. DO NOT ADD ANYTHING OR REMOVE ANYTHING FROM THESE TUBES. DO NOT BREAK OR DISPOSE OF THESE TUBES!!

· Resuspend your samples by inverting several times.

· Place a tube in the spectrophotometer and close the sample lid.

· After your reading stabilizes (several seconds) read the absorbance.

· Remove and save your samples.

· When all samples have been read, turn off your spectrophotometer using knob A.

· Go to the other five stations to collect your classmates data.

Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ Observations

• Carefully record the absorbance data from all six stations in a table. An example table is given on the next page.

• Plot your six growth curves on semi-log paper or use a semi-log plot in Excel.

• Calculate the slopes of the linear portions of each plot.

• Use the slopes to calculate g (in minutes) for each culture.

• Use the g values to calculate k (in hours-1) for each culture.

• Plot k vs. temperature (k on y-axis and temperature on x-axis)

✪ Conclusions

1. What phases of growth did you observe in your samples?

2. Which temperature had the fastest growth rate?

3. What type of growth (psychrophile, mesophile, thermophile) did this culture show?

Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash.

Spectrophotometer samples

Do not throw the sample tubes away! Return your tubes to the test tube rack at your station. These samples contain barium chloride and a weak solution of sulfuric acid. If you manage to break or spill a tube, clean up with a copious amount of water. Also, let your lab instructor know.

Contaminated materials

We should not contaminate anything today. If you do, however, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
