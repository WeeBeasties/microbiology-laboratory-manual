Microbial Symbioses

Background

Most microorganisms live together in interacting communities in the environment. These inter-microbial relationships form the base of the (and sometimes the entire) food web. Microbes can exhibit any and all of the possible relationships with other microbes. Some common relationships that we have seen (and you should know) from the lab are:



Competition: A contest between organisms for territory, a niche, or resources. Soil bacteria are often in direct competition for carbon sources (such as starch) in their environment. In this case, neither organism fully thrives – both are harmed somewhat.

Cooperation: The process of groups of microbes working or acting together for their common/mutual benefit. An example of this is quorum sensing (talked about in regulation in our lectures). Both organisms can benefit from this interaction.

Predation: An interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators tend to be as large or larger than their prey. An example is Paramecium consuming bacteria. Obviously, the predator benefits, but the prey…. Not so much.

Mutualism: A relationship two organisms of different in which each individual benefits from the activity of the other. This is exemplified by lichen, ruminants, and alfalfa.

Commensalism: A class of relationships between two organisms where one organism benefits without affecting the other. Many members of your microbiota are commensal – they benefit from you but not vice versa.

Amensalism: An interaction where an organism inflicts harm to another organism without any costs or benefits received by the actor. An example of this is antibiotic production by a fungus.

Parasitism: An interaction where one species, the parasite, benefits at the expense of the other, the host. Parasites tend to be smaller than their hosts. An example of a parasite is bacteriophage T4 (all viruses are considered to be obligate intracellular parasites).

In this exercise, you will be observing examples of mutualism and commensalism. You have seen examples of parasitism and amensalism in previous exercises.

Instructions

Day 1: While working in pairs, you should set up three nutrient broth tubes as follows:

· Label the tubes 1, 2, and 3 and put a symbol on each of the caps to make it easier to find them again.

· Flame a loop and let it cool. Then use the loop to add a small amount of Staphylococcus aureus (from the plate provided) to tube number 1.

· Repeat the prior step to inoculate tube number 3 with S. aureus as well.

· Using a sterile Pasteur pipette, add three drops of the Clostridium sporogenes broth culture to tubes number 2 and 3.

· Loosely cap all three tubes and incubate at 35°C.

Day 2: Observe the growth in your three tubes.

· Record your observations in your notebook.

· Gram stain the cultures from tubes 1 and 3.

· Use about 3 loopfuls of each on separate slides. Let this air dry and then heat fix.

· Record your observations in your notebook

In addition, you should observe the examples of lichen displayed in our lab. These lichen are actually communities of fungi and algae.

Finally, you will need to prepare a wet mount of termite hindgut contents.

· Put a drop of water on a microscope slide.

· Capture a termite and place it in the drop of water.

· Use a coverslip to squash the termite. You will thereby release the hindgut contents (bacteria and protozoa) for viewing.

· View using your high dry objective (you will want to reduce the brightness of the light using the iris in the substage condenser).

· Try to find ciliate protozoa and spiral-shaped bacteria. These are actually the microbes responsible for cellulose degradation in the termite.





Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.



✪ Observations

• Clearly record the appearance of your broth tubes. You can draw them using the following diagrams or photograph them and tape the picture into your notebook.

• Carefully record the size, shape, arrangement, and color of the cells in tubes 1 and 3. Search around your slides and make sure that you see all types of cells present.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1) Record the view of the ocular micrometers and bacterial cells in focus for each of the eight different samples. Make sure that you clearly label your samples.

2) Using the panels below, draw an accurate representation of each sample. Make sure that you label each sample well. Also ensure that your drawings show the correct size, shape, arrangement, and color of each cell type.

You should also include a picture or drawing of the termite hindgut contents and the lichens that you observed.



✪ Conclusions

1. Why was there no growth in tube 2?

2. What sort of relationship is illustrated in tube 3?

3. Which microbe benefitted from the relationship in tube 3?

4. How does the result in tube three relate to gingivitis (gum disease)?

5. What would happen to the termites if all its hindgut microbes were eliminated? Why?

Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

Dispose of your Pasteur pipettes, glass slides and coverslips in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:



1. Staphylococcus aureus (BSL-2) This is commonly found on your skin and in your nose.

2. Clostridium sporogenes (BSL-1) This is basically Clostridium botulinum without toxins.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your stains.

Compound light microscope

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X (red striped, scan) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.

Contaminated materials

Dispose of your three broth tubes in the unlined silver buckets when you have completed your observations and stains. If you spill any cultures, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
