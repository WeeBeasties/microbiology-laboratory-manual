Enterobacteriaceae Biochemistry

Background

The Enterobacteriaceae are a family of gamma proteobacteria that includes familiar microbial genera like Escherichia, Salmonella, and Yersinia. Members of the Enterobacteriaceae are bacilli, and are typically 1-5 μm in length. Like other Proteobacteria they stain Gram negative and are facultative anaerobes. The ferment sugars (all can ferment glucose) to produce a mixture of solvents, organic acids, and gasses asa end products (varying by strain). Most also reduce nitrate to nitrite via anaerobic respiration. Unlike most similar bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae generally lack cytochrome c oxidase. Most have many flagella used to move about, but a few genera are non-motile. They are non-spore forming. Most members of the Enterobacteriaceae produce catalase. Some members of this family are able to ferment lactose – these are referred to as coliforms. Coliforms are less commonly pathogenic, and are used as indicators of water quality. Non-coliforms cannot ferment lactose and are more often act as human pathogens.

We are going to use several biochemical tests to differentiate between (and ultimately, to identify) various members of this family. Here is a little background on the tests that we are using.

MacConkey agar: This is a selective and differential medium. The media contains bile salts and crystal violet dye – both of which inhibit the growth of most Gram positive organisms. It also contains neutral red dye and lactose. Microbes the grow on MacConkey agar may either ferment lactose or not. If they do, the acids they produce turn the indicator dyes red. If enough acid is produced, the bile salts precipitate and the plate appears cloudy around the areas of growth. If lactose is not fermented, the colonies remain colorless.

Indole: Indole is produced as a breakdown product of the amino acid tryptophan. Indole reacts with Kovac’s reagent to turn bright red.

Triple Sugar Iron Agar: This media contains three sugars (0.1% glucose, 1% lactose, and 1% sucrose) along with a acid indicator – phenol red. All Enterobacteriaceae ferment glucose and will turn the entire tube yellow (acid) within 12 hours or so. However, there is very little glucose, so only a little acid is produced. Over the next 12 to 36 hours, bacteria on the slant begin to use amino acids for catabolism. In the process, ammonia (basic) is produced and the pH of the media at the slant becomes neutral (red). However, if lactose and/or sucrose is also fermented so much acid is produced that the tube will remain completely yellow. Gasses produced during fermentation will appear as bubbles or cracks in the media following incubation. Finally, the iron in TSI is used to indicate H2S production. Hydrogen sulfide produced from breakdown of the amino acid cysteine reacts with the iron to form ferric sulfide (black).

MRVP: The methyl red, Voges Proskauer media is used to detect two different fermentation end products – strains will make one or the other. Methyl red is an acid indicator (it turns red in the presence of organic acids). The Voges Proskauer reagents (A and B) are used to detect acetoin (also known as acetylmethylcarbinol). The test also turns red.

Citrate: This media is used to detect the metabolism of citrate by microbes. In addition to citrate, it contain a pH indicator – bromthymol blue. At acidic pH (citrate present), the media is green. However, if citrate is metabolized, the pH will become basic and the media will turn blue.

Urea: Some bacteria can break down urea to ammonia (basic) and carbon dioxide. This media contains urea and the pH indicator phenol red. Under alkaline conditions, the indicator will turn pink.

Instructions

Observe each of the sets of inoculated media and interpret the results that you see. The indole test will need to be performed once for each isolate in lab. Based upon the results that you record, you should create a dichotomous key that is sufficient to identify any of the eight bacterial isolates.

For those of you that haven’t made or used a dichotomous key in a while – here is a brief overview. The key is actually a decision tree. Each node of the key consists of a question with two (and only two) possible answers. The most efficient keys divide all possible responses into groups of roughly equal sizes. For instance: consider the following.

Strain one

Strain two

Strain three

Strain four

Test 1

Test 2

The first test differentiates between strains 1 and 2 vs strains 3 and 4. Test 2 can be used to tell strains 1 and 2 apart. Likewise, test 3 and tell strains 3 and 4 apart. Therefore, the dichotomous key could be drawn as show below.



Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

You might consider including representative pictures of the tests too (either hand drawn or photographs of the media). This could be very helpful when you are studying for the laboratory practical exam. Just saying…



✪ Conclusions

1. A complete and correct dichotomous key (based upon your observations) is the only conclusion necessary for this exercise. You will be using this key to identify a bacterial unknown in a future exercise.



Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. Citrobacter freundii (BSL-1). This microbe is commonly found in soil and water. This species – though not this strain – accounts for many nosocomial infections.

2. Enterobacter aerogenes (BSL-1) This organism is part of the normal gut microbiota. It can cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals.

3. Escherichia coli (BSL-1) The K12 strain is the most genetically studied organism on the planet.

4. Klebsiella pneumoniae (BSL-2) Strains of this microbe can cause pneumoniae in kids.

5. Proteus vulgaris (BSL-2). This microbe is an opportunistic pathogen associated with urinary tract infections.

6. Salmonella enteritidis (BSL-2). This microbe is commonly found in bird and reptile feces. It is responsible for most of the salmonella infections that you hear about in the news.

7. Serratia marcescens (BSL-1). This microbe is famous for producing a red pigment (Prodigiosin). It is, however, rarely pathogenic

8. Shigella sonnei (BSL-2) Strains of this microbe can cause diarrheal infections.

Return the bacterial cultures when you have completed your observations.

Contaminated materials

We should not contaminate anything today. If you do, however, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
