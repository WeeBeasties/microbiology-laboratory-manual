Bacteriophage Counts


Background

Bacteriophage are viruses of prokaryotic cells. As such, they are obligate intracellular parasites. Phage are very small (<200 nm) and therefore cannot be resolved with our light microscopes. We are going to enumerate (estimate the number of) a phage called T4 in this lab exercise. T4 is a lytic phage of Escherichia coli and is sometimes referred to as a coliphage. One virus particle that infects one bacterial cell will result in about 400 viruses being released when that infected cell lyses 100 minutes later. This is a much faster rate of replication than the bacterial rate (E. coli would make about 32 cells in the same time period). As a consequence, viral propagation can overwhelm the host cells. On solid media, this results in holes (called plaques) in the bacterial lawn.

Viral plaques can be counted in much the same way that we counted Staphylococcus aureus colonies. These counts can be used to calculate the number of microbes present. We will serially dilute a viral stock in sterile diluent (peptone broth this time). The diluted viruses will be added to virus food (E. coli host cells) and plated. After incubation, plaques (areas of cell death) will appear on the plates. Even though we are counting areas of cell death instead of areas of cell growth, the math remains the same. You will report your findings in pfu/ml (plaque forming units per milliliter) instead of cfu/ml – for obvious reasons.

Instructions

We will work in groups today to dilute and plate a stock of bacteriophage T4. Each pair will perform the following steps to determine the number of pfu/ml. Refer to the following figure for a graphic guide.

· Obtain a suspension of Escherichia coli host cells.

· Get six tubes of diluent (0.9 ml peptone broth) and label them 3 to 8.

· Have your lab instructor use a micropipette to transfer 100 µl of the 10-2 T4 stock into dilution tube 3.

· Serially dilute bacteriophage T4 by sequentially transferring 0.1 ml (3 drops) to each of the remaining diluent tubes.

· Get four empty infection tubes and label them 5 – 8.

· Add 0.1 ml of Escherichia coli host cells (0.1 ml) to each tube.

· Add 0.1 ml of diluted phage from the 105, 106, 107, and 108 dilutions to the corresponding infection tubes.

· Get four bottom agar plates and label each with the dilution (5, 6, 7, or 8), your section number, and your group’s symbol.

· Add 7 ml molten top agar to an infection tube and immediately pour onto the surface of the corresponding bottom agar plate. Pour it on the agar surface! Tip it to spread the top agar evenly over the plate’s surface.

· Set the plate aside for a few minutes to allow the top agar to solidify.

· Repeat this process for each of the infection tubes

· Incubate the solidified plates bottoms up at 35°C for 24 hours.

Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ Observations

• Carefully record the general appearance of your plates following incubation. Also record the number of plaques observed on the plates.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1) Draw a detailed picture of your plates’ appearance. Make sure that you clearly label your samples and identify cfu numbers.

2) Take photographs of your plates and include them along with plaque counts in your lab notebook.

✪ Conclusions

1. What was the final dilution for your last plate? Show your calculation.

2. What was the series dilution factor for tube 3? Show your calculation.

3. What was the pfu/ml estimate from your dilution? Show your calculations.

4. List two factors that might contribute to underestimation of plaque counts from lower dilutions.



Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

Dispose of any broken glass in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. You should also dispose of any glass pipettes in the glass box.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

• Escherichia coli (BSL-1). This is a common member of your gut microbiota.

• Bacteriophage T4 (BSL-1). This virus can only infect some strains of E. coli.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your stains.

Contaminated materials

Dispose of all of your used test tubes (dilution, infection, and pour tubes) in the unlined silver cans. Return any unused pipettes when you are done with your dilutions. Also, do not throw the pipette tubes away when empty; return them to the rack with blue tape. When you are finished observing the plates, they should be disposed of in the orange biohazard bags.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
