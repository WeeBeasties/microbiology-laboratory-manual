## White Blood Cells

### Background

Many cells of our immune system are associated with lymphatic tissues (lymph nodes, the spleen, etc.). Other important immune cells are found in our circulation. These are the leukocytes, or “white blood cells”. There are five different types of white blood cells in human blood, each performs a different function and is present at different levels. A normal person has between 5 x 106 and 1 x 107 white blood cells per ml. In addition to being important for immunity (obviously), imbalances in leukocyte levels can provide clues to underlying disease conditions. In today’s exercise, you will determine the relative abundance of leukocytes in a prepared slide of human blood. This is referred to as a differential blood count. The five types of cells that you will be counting are described in the table below.

** Neutrophil** – (approximately 62%)
This is the most common white blood cell. Neutrophils are a type of granulocyte and are the main phagocytic cells in our circulation. You can recognize these by their lobed (3-5 lobes connected by thin strands of nuclein) nucleus. Elevated neutrophil numbers (neutrophilia) are usually indicative of a microbial infection.
**Lymphocyte** – (approximately 30%)
These include the B-cells and T-cells of the adaptive immune response. Microscopically, you cannot differentiate between the types of lymphocytes. Elevated numbers, lymphocytosis, can indicate an infection (or more rarely – cancer).
**Monocyte** – (approximately 5%)
These immune cells ultimately differentiate into tissue macrophage and dendritic cells. They are important antigen presenting cells. Elevated levels, monocytosis, can be caused by chronic infections (such as syphilis or tuberculosis).
**Eosinophil** – (approximately 3%)
These cells are filled with pink stained granules. Their function is primarily to deal with worm infections (like trichonosis). Unfortunately, they are also associated with type I hypersensitivity (allergies). Either of these conditions will lead to elevated levels (eosinophilia).
**Basophile** – (<1%)
This is the rarest of the circulating leukocytes. These cells are filled with granules that stain purple (and often obscure the view of the nucleus). Elevated levels (basophilia), is associated with anemia and some microbial infections (like chicken pox).
### Instructions
Observe one of the commercially prepared human blood slides using your high dry (40X) objective. You may use oil if you wish (the photo that I took – see above – were made using the oil objective).

· You will need to find one example of each type of blood cell and record its appearance.
· Count between 100 and 200 leukocytes and tally the number of each type.

### Notebook Entry
To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

### ✪ Observations
• Carefully record the size, shape, and appearance of each of the white blood cells in your slide. Search around your slides and make sure that you all five types – you might have to hunt a while to find a basophile.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1) Using the panels below, draw an accurate representation of each cell. Make sure that you label each one well. Also ensure that your drawings show the correct size, shape, and color of each cell type.

2) Using your cell phone, take a picture of each cell type. Ensure that you also capture the ocular micrometer to calculate the cell’s size. Print your photos and tape them into your lab notebook. Make sure that you label each of your photos.

You should also count between 100 and 200 white blood cells as you slowly and methodically scan your slide. Record the number of each type of cell that your observe in a table like this one.

Neutrophil

Lymphocyte

Monocyte

Eosinophil

Basophil

### ✪ Conclusions

1. Were the percentages of each cell type similar to the normal range?

2. What would happen to the cell distribution if this individual had severe allergies?

3. Which of these cells is/are most associated with the adaptive immune response?

4. Which of these cells is/are phagocytes?

### Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

**Glass waste**  -  Any broken glass should be placed in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash.

**Commercial Slides**  -  Do not throw the commercial slides or the hanging drop slides away! Wipe any immersion oil off of the slides using a Kimwipe. Then return the slide to the correct slide box. Return the hanging drop slides to the indicated container for later cleaning.

**Compound light microscope**

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X (red striped, scan) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.

Contaminated materials

We should not contaminate anything today. If you do, however, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
