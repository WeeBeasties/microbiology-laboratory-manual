Lysozyme

Background

Lysozyme is a protein found in tears, saliva, and other secretions. It is essentially a peptidoglycan hydrolase and is an important component of our innate immune defenses. This protein is also abundant in egg whites (one of the four most abundant there) and is one of the major contributors to egg allergies.

While most of the body is protected by a covering of dead and keratinized skin cells, the eyes and mucous membranes do not have this protection. Lysozyme is produced in tears and mucus secretions to provide extra protection in these areas against invasion by bacteria. It is also present in the blood to help keep bacteria from being spread throughout the body.

Lysozyme is of historical interest, since it was the one of the first antibacterial substances described by Sir Alexander Fleming. Fleming, who went on to discover penicillin, had a cold and put a drop of mucus on a plate of bacteria. He discovered that the mucus killed the bacteria, but the molecule is too large to be practical as a drug. Many years later, this protein was the first enzyme to have its three-dimensional structure solved.

Instructions

We are going to compare the sensitivity of two microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus, to lysozyme from four different sources. We will use purified lysozyme (commercially prepared), egg whites, tears, and saliva.

You will inoculate your plates with the pure cultures provided; do a 3+1 streaking procedure to ensure a uniform lawn of microbial growth. Divide the plate into quarters on the bottom half using a sharpie. Label each quarter for one of the four sources, and add your initials and lab section number to identify your plate later. Use the onions provided in lab to induce tear formation and touch a sterile paper disk to one tear (not directly to your eye – ouch!). Place that disk in the tear sector of your plate. Touch the other disks to the other sources and place them on the corresponding quarters of your plates. Incubate your plates at 35°C, bottoms up, until next time.



Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.



✪ Observations

• Carefully record the appearance of your Micrococcus and Escherichia plates. You may record these data in one of two ways:

1) Photograph your plates and tape a copy in your notebook. Make sure that you clearly label your samples.

2) Using the panels below, draw an accurate representation of each sample. Make sure that you label each sample well.









✪ Conclusions

1. Which microorganism was more resistant to lysozyme?

2. What is the most likely reason for this result?

3. Which source of lysozyme gave the best results?



Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. Escherichia coli (BSL-1). The K12 strain that we use in our laboratory is not especially virulent. It is the most genetically studied microbe on the planet.

2. Micrococcus luteus (BSL-1) This bacterium is a gram positive saprophyte and is a member of the normal microbiota of human skin.

Return the bacterial cultures when you have completed your inoculations.

Contaminated materials

After making your observations, you should dispose of your petri dishes in the silver cans that are lined with the orange biohazard bags. If you spill any of the cultures, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
