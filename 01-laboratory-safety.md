## Exercise 01  

-------------

### Background

**Right to Know / Chemical Labeling** - You have a right to know (and are expected to know) about all chemicals (including consumer products) you will be exposed to in the lab class. All materials will be labeled with the NAME (no abbreviations) of the material and its HAZARD if any (e.g. flammable, corrosive, oxidizer etc.).

**Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)** - Additional information about chemicals/products is available from the Ferris Environmental Health and Safety officer in the form of Material Safety Data Sheets. Requests for MSDS will be honored. I suggest that you search for the appropriate information on-line at http://www.msdssearch.com. Use the DB tab to search several web databases.

### Laboratory Attire

Clothing - The laboratory is a dirty and potentially dangerous place. To minimize the likelihood of personal injury you should avoid loose-fitting clothing. I also strongly recommend that you wear older clothes in the lab – the stains that we use bind very avidly to cloth.

Hair - If your hair is long enough to be tied back, please do so in the laboratory. The smell of singed hair in the Bunsen burners is most unpleasant.

Shoes - Close-toed footwear must be worn at all times in the lab. Your shoes should be appropriate for the lab; avoid high heels!

Lab coat - You are required to purchase and wear a lab coat during all laboratory sessions. The coat will protect you and your clothing from biological contamination and chemical spills. I may allow a non-standard garment in place of a lab coat provided that it is of an appropriate size and composition.

Goggles - Safety goggles must be worn when working with hazardous materials or conditions that can injure the eyes or skin. You will be instructed to don your goggles when required to do so.

General Policies

Attendance - Because the laboratory is an essential component of this course, I will be keeping attendance. Students with more than two unexcused absences will fail the course.

Conduct - Inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated. All members of the class - students and instructor - will treat each other with respect. I have the right to ask a student to leave if he or she is behaving inappropriately, disrupting class, or refuses to promptly and fully comply with any of these safety policies.

No eating/drinking/food/smoking - No food or drink is allowed in the laboratory. Students must leave these things outside, or keep them in their closed backpacks. THIS INCLUDES PERSONAL WATER BOTTLES!

Reporting Accidents/Incidents - Injuries, dangerous equipment failures, chemical spills, etc. must be immediately reported to me. Injured students should go to the Student Health Center for medical evaluation. You may walk there with an escort or may be transported by University Police. Do not attempt to clean up blood other than your own!

Health concerns - If you are currently taking any medications that suppress your immune system, know yourself to have any condition that compromises your immune system, or are pregnant (or have reason to believe you might be), you must notify your instructor. In most cases you will be able to participate in all the experiments; however, this information will ensure that any additional precautions that might be required for your safety are implemented. To maintain the confidentiality of this information any such additional precautions will be applied to all students.

Bench cleaning - At the beginning and end of each lab session you should wipe your workspace down with an antiseptic (Roccal). Please dispose of any dirty paper towels in the regular trash bins.

Handwashing - The single most important procedure to protect you this semester is regular and thorough handwashing. At the end of each lab session (and anytime that you believe that you may have contaminated yourself) you should wash your hands using the provided antimicrobial soap and hot water.

Spills - If any water is spilled on the floor, it must be cleaned up immediately to prevent slip/fall injuries or damage to the rooms below and adjacent to the lab. If the water can’t be easily cleaned up, notify me so that I can get a spill kit.

Waste Disposal

Housekeeping - You must clean up after yourself. Trash must not be left in the room, thrown into drawers, sinks, on the floor, etc. Sinks clogged with student trash can cause a flood in the lab.

Regular trash - Please put all of your non-contaminated trash in the regular trash bins. DO NOT PUT SOLID TRASH IN THE SINKS! This includes used matches.

Stains - Do not dump stains down the drain. There is a large labeled carboy at the front of the lab for stain waste collection.

Glass - Broken glass should be reported to me – do not attempt to clean it up yourself. Glass waste is collected in a separate container. Please do not put glass waste in the regular trash – our custodial staff thank you.

Chemicals - I will provide containers and instruction for disposal of chemical wastes generated in the lab. Do not dump anything into the sinks unless I have specifically instructed you to do so.

Contaminated materials - Small spills should be saturated with Roccal and wiped up with a paper towel. Place these towels in the orange autoclave bag at the front of the lab. When you are done with cultures, they should be disposed of in the orange autoclave bag. Contaminated glassware will be collected in a bin at the front of the lab for later decontamination.

Safety Equipment

Eyewash - There is an emergency eye wash in the sink at the front of the lab. The path to this wash must remain clear during class. The shower stays ON when the handle is pulled. You must use the wash for 15 minutes minimum. During the 15-minute flushing, you should use your fingers to hold your eyelids open. Do not worry about looking silly or making a mess – your vision is at stake!

Fire alarm - In case of a fire there is an alarm pull in the hallway outside of our laboratory. If appropriate, pull the alarm and evacuate the building.

Fire extinguisher - An A/B/C class fire extinguisher is mounted on the wall near the back of the lab. Trained people should only use this device. DON’T BE A HERO. Evacuate the room and pull the fire alarm as appropriate.

Fire blanket - There is also a fire blanket mounted at the front of the lab. To use, open the fire blanket and hold it in front of you to shield your body (especially the face and hands) from the fire. Cover the burning material completely, ensuring there are no gaps for oxygen to reach the fire. Leave the blanket in place, allowing the material to cool for at least 30 minutes before lifting the blanket. If appropriate, shut of the gas or electrical supply if it is involved in the fire. Contact the fire department if you have not already done so.



Evacuation Route - If the fire alarm sounds, or you are ordered out of the lab, you must immediately leave the building taking your backpacks with you! If possible, turn off Bunsen burners and other equipment before leaving. I will tell you the safest and quickest route out of the building. EVERYONE MUST GET 200 FEET AWAY from the building – do not bunch-up just outside the doorway!

Tornado policy - If a tornado warning is announced during class, we will move to a designated storm shelter - in our case, the hallway outside of the lab. Keep all doors shut and avoid windows as much as possible. If you are unable to get out of the lab in time, take cover beneath our rather substantial laboratory benches.

Laboratory Hazards

Bunsen burners - You must follow my instructions for lighting and using Bunsen burners in the lab. Never EVER leave a lit Bunsen burner unattended – the blue flame is difficult to see in a well-lit lab setting.

Bacterial stocks - Most of the experiments you will do in the microbiology lab involve the use of living microbes. Although many of these microbes are considered non-pathogenic, not likely to cause disease in healthy individuals, they must all be handled as though they were pathogenic, likely to cause disease in healthy individuals. Safe handling of microorganisms will be emphasized as you perform each of the experiments, both to protect you and your classmates from infection and to ensure that the microbes themselves do not become contaminated with other unwanted microbes. The organisms that we use in our laboratory exercises are classified as either Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) or Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2).

BSL-1: These microbes include well-characterized agents not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adult humans, and of minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. Typical examples of BSL-1 organisms include non-pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

BSL-2: These microbes there pose a moderate hazard to people and the environment. They are typically indigenous and associated with diseases of varying severity. However, infections are not easily transmissible and effective treatments are readily available. An example of a microbe that is typically worked with at a BSL-2 laboratory is Staphylococcus aureus.

Other - Specific instructions will be provided when you are working with other potentially chemicals or conditions. These may include ultraviolet radiation, combustible gases or solutions, caustic chemicals, or high-voltage equipment. Stay alert and follow instructions.

Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exerci se are given below.

✪ Observations

After reviewing our safety guidelines, you should identify and illustrate to locations of the following objects:

1) All windows and doors in our lab.

2) All lab benches and the location of your seat in the lab.

3) The emergency gas shut off valve.

4) The fire extinguisher

5) The fire blanket

6) The eyewash station

7) The stain waste barrel

8) The contaminated waste buckets

9) The broken glass boxes

10) The regular trash cans

You can illustrate all of this with a simple floor plan sketch or map.

✪ Conclusions

· What is your laboratory drawer number?

· What is you microscope number?

· Where is the tornado evacuation location?

· What is the most dangerous piece of equipment in our lab?

· What biosafety level are most of our bacterial stocks in the lab?



Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

There should be no glass waste today. However, you should now know where to dispose of broken glass in the lab.

Compound light microscope

Although we did not yet use the microscopes in lab, you should have signed up for a specific instrument. Make sure that you can locate it in lab.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
