Lactose Operon Regulation

Background

The lac operon encodes three proteins: β‐galactosidase (the product of the lacZ gene), lactose permease (the product of the lacY gene), and lactose transacetylase (the product of the lacA gene). The function of lacA is not known, but a mutation in either lacZ or lacY means that the cell can't grow by using lactose as a sole carbon source. All three structural genes are transcribed from a common promoter site, in the direction Z à Y à A. The lac transcript is termed polycistronic because it contains more than one coding sequence.

Closely linked to the lac structural genes is the gene ( lacI) for the lac repressor, a tetramer of four identical subunits. The repressor has two functions. First, it binds to the DNA near the lac promoter and prevents transcription of the structural genes. Secondly, it binds to a small molecule called an inducer. In the cell, the inducer is allolactose, a metabolite of lactose. The binding of inducer to the repressor is cooperative, meaning that the binding of one molecule of inducer makes binding of the next one more favorable, and so on. This means that the repressor binds inducer in an all or none fashion.

In the absence of inducer, the repressor protein binds to a sequence called the operator ( lacO) which partially overlaps with the promoter. When it is bound to the operator, lac repressor allows RNA polymerase to bind the promoter and form an open complex but not to elongate transcription. Repressor is therefore a negative regulator of gene expression: If repressor is not present (for example, the bacterium is deleted for the lacI gene), then transcription of the lac genes occurs, and the structural genes are expressed whether or not inducer is present. The unregulated, “always on” expression caused by a lacI ‐ mutation is called constitutive expression. This behavior is characteristic of a negative control element. Other mutations of lacI disrupt its ability to bind the inducer. These proteins (termed lacIs) never leave the operator and result in repressed expression. LacO is another negative element. Deletion of lacO leads to constitutive expression of the lac genes. Mutation of lacO, that result in loss of repressor binding (called lacOc) also result in constitutive expression. The difference between these mutation can be seen when the genes are put into an artificial situation where two copies of the relevant control genes exist (this condition is called a merozygote).

Jacob and Monod used the fertility plasmid (F) from Escherichia coli to study the regulation of the lactose operon. They used a variant of this plasmid (called F’) that contained a normal functional copy of the lactose operon genes. For our purposes, we will assume that the F’ contains a functional LacI and LacZ protein and that the LacZ gene on the F’ contains wild type operator and promoter sequences. Five strains (wild type, LacI-, LacZ- LacIs, and LacOc) will be considered in this exercise. These strains were grown in the presence of glucose (G) or lactose (L). In addition, the F’ construct was introduced into the strains by conjugation and these strains were also grown in the presence of glucose or lactose. Enzyme activity of LacZ (beta galactosidase) in these four cultures was measured using ONPG. This is a colorless chemical analog of lactose. When cleaved by LacZ, ortho-nitrophenol (yellow in color) is produced. Therefore, if the cultures turn yellow, the lactose operon (LacZ at least) is being expressed. If LacZ is not expressed or functional, the cultures remain colorless.

Instructions

Based upon what you have learned so far, complete the worksheet for the five strains.

Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ Observations and Conclusions

• Carefully record the LacZ activity of all 10 culture tubes. The best way to do this is to cut out the pictures from your work sheet and tape them into your notebook. For each of the five strains, indicate the phenotype observed for the mutant and merozygote, the genotype if the mutants and provide a brief explanation (in your own words) of what is going on in these tubes.

Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
