Wastewater Treatment

Background

For this exercise, we will be touring the Big Rapids wastewater treatment plant. We will meet at the plant. You may follow these directions the plant – it is by the river near the dog park.

The wastewater plant performs three main functions:

1) Physical removal of large and undesirable objects.

2) Biological and/or chemical removal of excess organic material.

3) Disinfection to reduce the number of potential pathogens.

Instructions

Attend the tour of the wastewater facilities and identify the locations and primary functions of the following :

Head works, screw pumps, grit and grease removal, aeration basins, equalization basin, FeCl3 addition, clarifiers, UV irradiation, sludge thickener, aerobic digesters, sludge storage. (one building was blocked by foliage – I indicated its position with a gray box).

Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ Observations

Clearly indicate the positions and functions of each of the items mentioned in the introduction.

✪ Conclusions

1. On average, about how many gallons of wastewater are treated here each day?

2. What is the dissolved oxygen level in the operating aeration basins? Why are these numbers different from each other?

3. What were the most recent numbers of fecal coliforms per 100 ml for the plant? How does this number compare with your previous mFC counts for the river?

4. Why shouldn’t you dump grease down your sink?



Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab. THIS SITE TREATS HUMAN WASTE THAT MAY CONTAIN VIABLE PATHOGENS! WASH YOUR HANDS!!
