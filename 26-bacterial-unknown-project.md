Bacterial Unknown Project

Background

This report is meant to be a sort of capstone project for our lab this semester. You will work on this project in pairs. Each person in the pair will be given a mixed culture of bacteria that we have seen this semester. Your goal is to isolate, identify, and describe these microbes.

Instructions

You should keep a record of what you have done, your observations, and your rationale for what you did on each day in your laboratory notebook. You will streak your mixture for isolation (using the BHI plate provided). You will then record their colony morphology (size, shape, margin, color, elevation, and general appearance). You will then select one of the plates to proceed with. Each of you will Gram stain one of your isolated bacteria and record the cell morphology of your isolates (size, shape, arrangement, and stain reaction). You will next perform the appropriate biochemical tests on the bacterium that you stained to identify it. You will also need to create and use a universal dichotomous key for the bacteria that includes your isolate (either Gram-negatives or –positives from before). Finally, you will need to write up a short description of the organisms that you isolated and identified. You should record all of the observations (yours and you partner’s) for the mixture that you selected. Don’t forget to record the unknown number prominently in your notebook.

Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

✪ Observations and Conclusions

Step 1, Streaking: Record (draw or photograph) the appearance of your streak plate. Provide a description of the colony morphologies that you observed. Get one new BHIA plate to subculture a representative of each colony type.

Step 2, Staining: Record (draw or photograph) the appearance of your Gram stain. Use proper terms to describe the cellular size, shape, and arrangement.

Step 3, Characterizing: Record the results of any and all biochemical tests that you performed on the unknowns. You should draw or photograph the biochemical tests to support your interpretations.

Step 4, Identifying: Use your dichotomous keys (from the Enterobacteriaceae and Gram positive cocci exercises) to identify your unknowns. You might consider using a highlighter to illustrate your decision path.

Step 5, Describing: Provide a brief paragraph for each of your isolates to describe what is known about their normal habitat and role in human disease. Remember to use proper scientific nomenclature! That is one of my pet peeves.

Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

Dispose of your microscope slides in the glass waste box when you are finished with your Gram stain. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. Your unknown contains two of the following:

1. Citrobacter freundii (BSL-1). This microbe is commonly found in soil and water. This species – though not this strain – accounts for many nosocomial infections.

2. Enterobacter aerogenes (BSL-1) This organism is part of the normal gut microbiota. It can cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals.

3. Escherichia coli (BSL-1) The K12 strain is the most genetically studied organism on the planet.

4. Klebsiella pneumoniae (BSL-2) Strains of this microbe can cause pneumoniae in kids.

5. Proteus vulgaris (BSL-2). This microbe is an opportunistic pathogen associated with urinary tract infections.

6. Salmonella enteritidis (BSL-2). This microbe is commonly found in bird and reptile feces. It is responsible for most of the salmonella infections that you hear about in the news.

7. Serratia marcescens (BSL-1). This microbe is famous for producing a red pigment (Prodigiosin). It is, however, rarely pathogenic

8. Shigella sonnei (BSL-2) Strains of this microbe can cause diarrheal infections.

9. Staphylococcus aureus (BSL-2). This microbe is the leading cause of wound infections. Even our teaching strain is a fairly aggressive opportunistic pathogen. Handle it carefully.

10. Staphylococcus epidermidis (BSL-1) This organism is part of the normal skin microbiota. It can cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals.

11. Streptococcus pyogenes (BSL-2) This is the organism that causes strep throat, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever.

12. Streptococcus pneumoniae (BSL-2) This organism is the leading cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

13. Streptococcus salivarius (BSL-1). This microbe is normal member of your oral microbiota. It is rarely pathogenic.

14. Enterococcus faecalis (BSL-2). This microbe is commonly found in bird and reptile feces. We used it as a indicator strain (fecal streptococci) in an earlier lab.

Place your unknown in the unlined silver bucket when you have finished all of your streaks.

Compound light microscope

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X (red striped, scan) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.

Contaminated materials

Place all used petri dishes into the orange bags in the silver buckets. All glass tubes should be placed in the unlined silver buckets. If you spill a culture, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
