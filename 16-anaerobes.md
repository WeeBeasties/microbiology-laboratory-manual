Anaerobes

Background

Oxygen is a very chemically reactive element and is absolutely required for the growth of many organisms (like us!). However, during metabolism, oxygen can form several toxic intermediates that can kill or inhibit microorganisms. These include superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical. These three molecules can cause oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA in cells. The ability of microbes to detoxify these deleterious byproducts varies, and thus different bacteria prefer different oxygen tensions in their growth media.

Organisms that require oxygen to live are called obligate aerobes. Obligate anaerobes are unable to use molecular oxygen to obtain energy and are usually killed or inhibited by its presence. Facultative anaerobes can use oxygen if it is available but can also grow when oxygen is absent. In contrast, aerotolerant anaerobes cannot use oxygen for growth, but they do tolerate its presence well. Some bacteria require a lower oxygen concentration than what is in the air. These organisms are classified as microaerophilic. A variety of culture methods have been developed to satisfy these diverse oxygen needs. Thioglycolate broth, anaerobic jars, and candle jars create alternative environments to atmospheric oxygen.

Thioglycolate Broth

Thioglycolate (thio) broth contains sodium thioglycolate and cysteine that act as reducing agents to create anaerobic conditions when they convert molecular oxygen to water. Dyes such as resazurin or methylene blue are usually added to the broth to provide a visual indication of the presence of oxygen. Resazurin is pink when oxidized and colorless when reduced. Methylene blue is blue when oxidized and colorless when reduced. Resazurin is present in the thioglycolate tubes that we will be using. The pink band near the top of the broth results when oxygen diffuses in. Strict aerobes will grow only in the pink band, microaerophiles will grow near the bottom of the band where the concentration of oxygen is lower. The absence of pink in the rest of the tube indicates the absence of oxygen and a suitable environment for strict anaerobes. Both facultative anaerobes and aerotolerant anaerobes will grow throughout the tube; however, facultative anaerobes will grow most densely where oxygen is present.

Anaerobic Jar

The Brewers Anaerobic agar plates employed for culturing our organisms do not contain reducing agents. They can however be used to culture anaerobes if they are placed inside an anaerobe jar - a chamber from which the oxygen is removed. Commercially available gas generator packets (e.g. GasPak) are placed in the jar along with plates or tubes containing conventional media destined to be incubated anaerobically. Opening the packet causes a chemical reaction to take place:

Sodium citrate plus Sodium bicarbonate react to release carbon dioxide (CO2)

Activated charcoal in the packet binds free oxygen gas (O2).

As a result of these reactions, the oxygen within the jar is removed and replaced with a carbon dioxide atmosphere. In order to assure that oxygen actually was removed from the chamber, a strip of paper soaked in methylene blue dye is included in the jar. It is blue when exposed to oxygen but will become colorless (white) when oxygen is absent. The Brewers anaerobic agar also includes methylene blue. When you first streak the plates, they should be a pale blue color. After incubation in the jar, they should appear colorless.

Instructions

Your lab section will work in six groups again.

Each group will obtain four fluid thioglycollate medium (FTM) tubes. Please handle the FTM tubes carefully – keep the tubes in an upright position; do not invert or agitate the tubes during or after inoculation. Secure the caps tightly before incubation. We do not want to introduce any more oxygen than is absolutely necessary.

The Brewer Anaerobic agar (BAA) plates are at the side demonstration table – each group needs two.

The broth cultures of Escherichia coli, Clostridium sporogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one of each/group) will be provided.

The anaerobe jars are clearly labeled with the section numbers that will use them – when ready place each of the anaerobe jars into the 35°C incubator labeled for it in the lab. Do not charge a jar until the last section indicated on the jar has placed its BAA plates into it.

Label the Brewer Anaerobic agar plates and divide the bottom into quarters. Streak each organism onto one quarter of the plates. Place one Brewer Anaerobic agar plate into the GasPak jar (bottoms up) and the other into the aerobic 35°C incubator (bottoms up).

Flame a loop, let it cool, and use it to obtain a small quantity of each broth culture. Insert the loop all the way to the bottom of a thioglycollate tube and gently swirl it around a little bit. Then, slowly withdraw the loop while continuing to gently swirl it. Mix the tube by rolling between your hands for about five seconds. Place your labeled and inoculated tubes into the provided rack in the 35°C incubator.

Notebook Entry

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.



✪ Observations

• Carefully record the growth in your thioglycollate tubes and on your BAA plates.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1) Take pictures using your camera. Tape the pictures into your lab book and label them well.

2) Carefully draw the appearance of your cultures in your lab book. Carefully label each illustration.



✪ Conclusions

1. Clostridium sporogenes was a(n) ____________________________________

2. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was a(n) ____________________________________

3. Enterococcus faecalis was a(n) ____________________________________

4. Escherichia coli was a(n) ____________________________________



Housekeeping

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

Glass waste

Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. Do not put anything sharp into the regular trash.

Bacterial cultures

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. Escherichia coli (BSL-1). The K12 strain is the most studied organism on the planet.

2. Clostridium sporogenes (BSL-1) This is basically Clostridium botulinum without toxins.

3. Enterococcus faecalis (BSL-2) This is an indicator strain for animal feces in ground water.

4. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (BSL-2) This is commonly found in wet environments and can be a potent pathogen under the right circumstances.

Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your stains.

Contaminated materials

Dispose of your BAA plates in the silver cans lined with the orange bags. Your fluid thioglycollate tubes should be put in the unlined silver buckets.

Laboratory bench

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount (a few milliliters) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

Cell phone / camera

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

Hand washing

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today (and every day) in the lab.
