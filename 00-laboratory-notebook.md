## How To Keep a Laboratory Notebook  

-------------

### Introduction to the Notebook  

Like sterile technique, microscopy, or biochemical analyses, keeping a current and accurate notebook is an essential skill in the microbiology laboratory. Your laboratory notebook will fulfill three primary functions in our course. First, it will give you the opportunity to develop a habit of properly documenting your laboratory activities. In a research lab, your notebook would be a permanent legal record of all your work. As such, it would be used to support grant applications, scientific publications, and patent applications by the members of your laboratory. Second, it will serve as your main study resource for the laboratory portion of our course. Your notebook should contain sufficient information to enable you or someone else to understand and reproduce the results of your work at a later date. This will be of particular importance as you review for our comprehensive laboratory practical exam at the end of this term. Finally, your notebook will help me to accurately evaluate your understanding of the laboratory materials and procedures that we use throughout the semester. By periodically collecting and grading your work, I can provide additional feedback to build upon your strengths and reinforce weaker areas so as to improve your learning this semester.

**Supplies** – This semester we will be using the hardcover _Student Laboratory Notebook_ published by the American Society for Microbiology Press, 2005\. (ISBN 1-55581-358-5) I have asked both the Ferris State University bookstore and Great Lakes Books to order copies for our labs. In addition, it can easily be found online at Amazon and other sites for about $12.00 (shipping is a couple dollars more). The style guide that we will be using in this class is _A Student Handbook for Writing in Biology_, 4<sup>th</sup> edition by Karin Knisely, Sinauer Associates, 2013\. (ISBN 978-1-4641-5076-0) This textbook will also be stocked by our bookstore and Great Lakes Books. Amazon and other online sites sell it for around $25.00\. References to materials in Knisely’s text will be abbreviated like this – _WIB_ p 8\. You are also going to need a solvent-resistant pen to write in your notebook. I find gel pens to be ideal for this purpose. The Pentel EnerGel with black ink is my personal favorite and can be found at our bookstores, Wal-Mart, Staples, and many other places for about $2.00 each.

**Grading** – Your completed laboratory notebook will be worth 150 out of the 1,400 total points this semester. I will collect all notebooks on announced days during the semester (see your laboratory schedule for the exact dates). On each of these occasions, the accuracy, completeness, and format of your entries will be graded out of five possible points per laboratory exercise using the checklist provided in this document. I will also provide some feedback in your notebooks concerning the strengths and weaknesses exhibited in your entries. The point of this work, however, is not the grade. Rather, I am interested in helping you to create an accurate record of your activities and observations during the semester. In addition, completion of your laboratory notebook will give you an opportunity to apply the scientific method in the lab (_WIB_ pp. 1-8).

### General Instructions

**Penmanship** – Your laboratory notebook will be of little value to anyone if it is not legible and comprehensible when viewed at a later date. Begin each entry on an odd-numbered page (on the right side of the book). Write using a solvent-resistant ink pen. Write clearly, organize entries, include detailed drawings of observations when appropriate.

**Personal information** – It will be important for me to be able to identify each of your notebooks when grading. To that end – I ask that you label the cover and spine of your notebook as illustrated in Figure 1. This information should include your full name, course name, lab section number, and lab room number.

**Notebook checklist** – You should print and cut out an extra copy of the laboratory notebook checklist found on our FerrisConnect site. Securely tape this copy onto the page facing the table of contents in your laboratory notebook. Refer to these guidelines when making your entries to ensure that they meet all of the notebook expectations when I am grading them.

• The laboratory exercise number (in ascending numerical order)

• A brief but clear title (the same as on the top of each page for the entry)

• The date that work on the exercise began

• The first page number for the exercise entry

**Figure 3** Proper table of contents

![Free Radical:Users:anaerobe:Desktop:DSCN1040.JPG](export/assets/free_radicalusersanaerobedesktop.jpeg)**Multi-page entries** – Most of our laboratory exercises will require more than one page to complete the entire entry. Fortunately, our notebooks provide an easy mechanism to facilitate longer entries. A the bottom of each leaf of your notebook, spaces are provided to indicate continuing pages. If you have filled in page 12 (for example) simply indicate “Continued on page 13” on the bottom of page 12 and “Continued from page 12” on page 13\. You can (and should) use both sides of each notebook leaf. The only exception to this rule is that each new exercise should begin on an odd-numbered page. If this requires leaving the preceding page blank, you should mark it as described later in this document.

![Free Radical:Users:anaerobe:Desktop:DSCN1048.JPG](export/assets/free_radicalusersanaerobedesktop.jpeg)**Multi-day entries** – Many of our exercises will require more than one day to complete. In these cases, you will need to indicate where each day’s work in lab stopped and when you picked it back up again later. This is accomplished by drawing a horizontal line beneath the point where your current day’s entry ends. You should sign and date your notebook above the line. Later, when you return to the exercise, you should indicate the date beneath the line and continue with the entry. Some of our laboratory exercises will span three or more class sessions and will require you to break your entries up into multiple sections in this manner.

![Free Radical:Users:anaerobe:Desktop:DSCN1047.JPG](export/assets/free_radicalusersanaerobedesktop.jpeg)**Correcting errors** –Your laboratory notebook is a working document (like a journal) and mistakes _will_ occur. The presence of errors in your entries will not result in a loss of points as long as they are properly corrected and they do not needlessly detract from the neatness, legibility, and clarity of your work. **NEVER** erase, blot out, or obscure information in your notebook. Neither should ever remove pages from your notebook. Instead, when you make a mistake in an entry simply strike through the material with a line (the entry should still be legible). You never know – what you thought was a mistake might turn out to be of some value later on during your work. It is also good practice to initial strikeouts and provide a brief explanation of the error (miscalculation, wrong sample name, etc.).

![Free Radical:Users:anaerobe:Desktop:DSCN1045.JPG](export/assets/free_radicalusersanaerobedesktop.jpeg)**Inserting information** – To simplify and standardize some portions of your laboratory entries, I will provide handouts to be included in your notebooks. You will cut these out to an appropriate size and permanently affix them to your notebook (scotch tape is preferred). Please indicate that there is nothing hiding beneath your insertions (and there should not be any overlapping materials in your entries). Loose sheets of paper in your notebooks are unacceptable.

![Free Radical:Users:anaerobe:Desktop:DSCN1046.JPG](export/assets/free_radicalusersanaerobedesktop.jpeg)**Unused space** – Any unused space in your notebooks (whether a complete page or just a portion of a page) needs to be struck out and initialed. This is to demonstrate that additional data or observations were not added to your notebook at a later date.

### Laboratory Entry Format

Your notebook entries should all have a common format and appearance. The six critical components of your entries are covered in out ancillary text. A brief description of each of these components is provided on the following page.

**Title** – (_WIB_, p 80) A short, but descriptive, title should be provided for each laboratory exercise. This title _must_ appear at the top of each corresponding page in your notebook and also be present in the table of contents (in chronological order).

**Purpose** – (_WIB_, p 79) A very brief explanation of the activity’s purpose should be present at the beginning of your entry. This only needs to be a few sentences long, but should adequately inform future readers about why you did the exercise and what you expected to find.

**Procedure** – (_WIB_, pp. 51-55) You should provide enough detail here to enable future readers to replicate your results. Alternatively, this section should have enough detail to remind you of what you did and how you did it when you need to reference it later this semester. You may cut and paste instructions from our lab handouts when applicable.

**Observations** – (_WIB_, pp. 55-75) Your observations in lab are amongst the most important parts of your notebook entries. Pay special attention to this part and put as much detail into your work as possible. Include tables of data, drawings, graphs, and other illustrations as you see fit. Please make sure to clearly label all illustrations, axes, and tables.

**Conclusions** – (_WIB_, pp. 75-78) Each laboratory exercise will include a few “critical thinking” questions. You will need to analyze your data and address these questions to complete the conclusion section.

**Signatures and dates** – One final point. You must sign and date every page of your notebook. In addition, you must have each page read and witnessed by a classmate. You can exchange notebooks with your lab partner to accomplish this.

### Notebook Grading Details  

Each laboratory exercise entry is worth five points; the entire notebook is worth 150 points (as much as the laboratory practical), so it pays to take it seriously. Your notebooks will be collected periodically during the semester – the dates of collection are indicated in the laboratory schedule in the course syllabus. Each entry will be scored by the laboratory instructor. To simplify scoring, the following codes will be used to identify areas where improvement could be made.

**TOC** – The table of contents entry should contain an exercise number, representative title, the date that the exercise was begun, and the first page number for the entry. Deviations from these requirements will result in a one-point deduction for the exercise.

**PEN** – The entire entry should be written in permanent ink (including the TOC entry). Any use of pencil for the entry will result in a one-point deduction for the exercise.

**SCI** – All scientific names should be completely spelled out and underlined the first time that they are mentioned in the entry (e.g. Escherichia coli). Thereafter, the genus may be abbreviated but the entry should still be underlined (e.g. E. coli). Any improper abbreviations, missing underlining, or mistakes in capitalization will result in a one-point deduction for the exercise.

**ERR** – One point will be deducted for each of the conclusion items in the entry that are answered incorrectly. Multi-part conclusions are either right or wrong; you cannot lose more than one point per conclusion item.

**INC** – One point will be deducted for each expected observation that is missing. Seriously deficient observations will be scored as missing.

**LBL** – All observations should be clearly recorded and labelled. One point will be deducted from the overall exercise score for poorly labelled or unclear entries.

**FMT** – The format of the entry should conform to the expectations set out in the Notebook Guide. One point will be deducted for the entry if it does not completely comply with those guidelines.
