# **Exercise 05**

## **Gram Stain**

---

### **Background**

The Gram stain was devised by a Danish physician, Hans Christian Gram, while he was working in Berlin in 1883. At the time, Dr. Gram was studying lung tissue sections from patients who had died of pneumonia. He was frustrated by the fact that common tissue staining procedures were inadequate to differentiate between host cells and microbial pathogens. So he set out to devise a more efficacious stain. Through a process of experimentation, Dr. Gram discovered that Gentian \(crystal\) violet and a solution of iodine mixed with potassium iodide formed a water-insoluble precipitate. This precipitate could be removed from host tissues and some microbial cells by an alcohol rinse. Many other microbes, however, retained the stain complex. This stain quickly became one of the main techniques used to initially characterize bacterial isolates. Like all differential stains, the Gram stain consists of four steps. These are summarized in the table below.

| Step | Compound | Time | Gram Positive | Gram Negative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary Stain | Crystal Violet | 1 minute | Purple | Purple |
| Mordant | Gram’s Iodine | 1 minute | Purple | Purple |
| Decolorizer | Acetone Alcohol | ~ 5 seconds | Purple | Colorless |
| Secondary Stain | Safranin | 1 minute | **Purple** | **Pink** |

For over 100 years, the Gram stain reaction has been thought to be associated with the cellular architecture of the bacterial cell wall. However, the actual mechanism of this stain was only worked out relatively recently. During staining, crystal violet-iodine complexes form inside the bacterial cells and on the cell walls. The decolorizing agent \(acetone alcohol\) dehydrates the cells and causes some leakage across the cell membrane. The intracellular dye complexes are trapped within gram positive cells due to the dense peptidoglycan saculus following dehydration. In gram negatives, however, the outer membrane is dissolved by the decolorizer and the peptidoglycan layer is insufficient to retain the dye complexes. Hence, the gram negative cells lose their color. The counterstain allows these cells to be visualized. The mechanism involved in this process is illustrated in my little video below.

Although widely used, the Gram stain does not work well for all microbes. Spirochetes like _Borellia_, _Treponema_, and _Leptospira_ are too thin to be resolved by brightfield microscopy - even when stained. In addition, some microbes are refractory to staining. The acid-fast bacteria \(_Mycobacterium_\) were recognized as difficult to stain by even Dr. Gram. This is due to the difficulty in getting stains into these microbial cells due to the waxy mycolic acid layer in their cell wall. Other intracellular bacterial parasites, like _Bartonella_, _Chlamydia_, and _Rickettsia_, are also known to be difficult to stain with analine dyes \(such as crystal violet\).

To complicate things further, even cells that are properly stained by this procedure can give variable results. One common reason for staining variability is the age of the culture. Many bacterial cells become more fragile with age \(eg in stationary and death phase\) and destain much more easily than younger cells. Other gram positive cells have a less substantial peptidoglycan layer and are, as a consequence, easier to destain. Confusion can arise when trying to describe the organisms in this section.

A proper Gram stain should result in either dark purple gram positive bacteria or lighter pink gram negative cells. A good stain from a mixed culture is shown to the right. This culture consisted of gram negative bacilli \(primarily present as individual cells\) and gram positive streptococci \(spherical bacteria mostly found in chains of four or more cells\). To give you and idea of the scale involved - the cocci in this image are a little under 1 µm in diameter while the bacilli are about 1 µm wide and 3 µm long. Due to its speed, low cost, and utility, the Gram stain is usually the first test performed when identifying a clinical isolate. In this exercise, you will be practicing the Gram stain on eight different mixed samples - comparing the size, shape, arrangement, and staining reactions of several different kinds of cells.

**Instructions**

You will work in pods \(groups of four\) and stain eight different samples. Each sample needs to be applied to a glass microscope slide and **heat fixed**. Then stain each sample using the steps described in the table above \(rinse the sample briefly with water between each step\). Blot dry at the conclusion of your staining procedure using bibulous paper and view with oil immersion.

Each person in your group must stain two of the following samples. You are responsible for recording accurate representations of all eight samples in your notebook. The samples that you will be observing consist of the following mixed cultures:

A\) _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_

B\) _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Candida albicans_

C\) _Enterococcus faecalis_ and _Moraxella catarrhalis_

D\) _Enterococcus faecalis_ and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_

E\) _Bacillus cereus_ and _Moraxella catarrhalis_

F\) _Bacillus cereus_ and _Rhodospirillum rubrum_

G\) _Candida albicans_ and _Rhodospirillum rubrum_

H\) Desquamated cheek cells

The cheek cells can be obtained by scraping the inside of your cheek with a clean toothpick. Apply the cells to a clean microscope slide, heat fix, and stain as described above.

**Notebook Entry**

To receive full credit for your work, your entry must contain the eight required components discussed in “Keeping a Notebook”. As a reminder, these sections are: a Table of Contents entry, title, the purpose, a procedure, your observations, your conclusions, the date, and the signatures. Take a moment to ensure that your notebook is complete and up-to-date. The most critical components are your observations and conclusions. Specific guidelines regarding your entry for this exercise are given below.

**✪ Observations**

• Carefully record the size, shape, arrangement, and color of the cells in the eight samples. This includes the two that you personally stained as well as the other six samples done in your pod.

You may record these data in one of two ways:

1\) Record the view of the ocular micrometers and bacterial cells in focus for each of the eight different samples. Make sure that you clearly label your samples.

2\) Using the panels below, draw an accurate representation of each sample. Make sure that you label each sample well. Also ensure that your drawings show the correct size, shape, arrangement, and color of each cell type.

✪ **Conclusions**

1. List all of the prokaryotic cells seen in this exercise:

**Housekeeping**

To keep our laboratory clean, safe, and organized, we ask that you adhere to some basic housekeeping protocols. Please ensure that you complete each of the following when you have finished working on this exercise for the day.

**Glass waste**

Dispose of your microscope slides in the glass waste box when you are finished for the day. Any broken glass should also be place in the glass waste box. **Do not **put anything sharp into the regular trash.

**Bacterial cultures**

We will be working with live microorganisms in this exercise. If spill the culture or otherwise contaminate yourself, you should disinfect your bench with Roccal and wash the contaminated area with plenty of soap and warm water. The cultures we are using include:

1. _Bacillus cereus_ \(BSL-1\). This is a common soil microbe. It forms endospores.

2. _Moraxella catarrhalis_ \(BSL-1\) This is commonly found on your skin and in your nose.

3. _Candida albicans_ \(BSL-1\) This yeast is a member of our body’s normal microbiota.

4. _Enterococcus faecalis_ \(BSL-2\) This microbe is commonly found in animal feces.

5. _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ \(BSL-2\) Strains of this microbe can cause pneumoniae in kids.

6. _Rhodospirillum rubrum_ \(BSL-1\) This is a phototrophic microbe from the soil.

7. _Staphylococcus aureus_ \(BSL-2\) This is commonly found on your skin and in your nose.


Return the bacterial culture when you have completed your stains.

**Compound light microscope**

Before returning your microscope to its respective bin, you should do the following:

1. Unplug the power cord and wrap it around the brackets on the microscope’s arm.

2. Rotate the head of the microscope so that the ocular lenses face toward the arm.

3. Clean any immersion oil off of the 100X objective lens using lens paper.

4. Rotate the objective turret so that the 4X \(red striped, scan\) objective is facing down.

5. Using the course focus knob, lower the microscope stage as far as it can go.

6. Carefully return your microscope to the correct cubby. Please orient the microscope such that the arm of the instrument faces out.


**Contaminated materials**

We should not contaminate anything today. If you do, however, soak the area with Roccal. Then clean up with paper towels and dispose of the mess in the lined silver buckets.

**Laboratory bench**

You should disinfect your lab bench at the beginning and end of each class session. Squirt a small amount \(a few milliliters\) of Roccal onto your bench top and wipe the surface with a paper towel. Dispose of the paper towel in our regular trash can. If you spill a microbial culture on the bench, spray the area with Roccal and allow to sit for two minutes. Then wipe the area with a paper towel and dispose of it in the silver bucket lined with the orange biohazard bag. Start doing this today.

**Cell phone \/ camera**

Before leaving the lab for the day, you should take a moment to disinfect the cellphone or camera that you used to make observations. Antimicrobial wipes are available in the lab for this purpose. Wipe all sides of your device with a single wipe and then dispose of the wipe in our regular trash can. Start doing this today too.

**Hand washing**

You should always wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before leaving the lab for the day. Dispose of the paper towel that you dried you hands with in the regular trash can. You should do this today \(and **_every day_**\) in the lab.
